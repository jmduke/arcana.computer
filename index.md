Hello! <strong>arcana dot computer</strong> is a weblog from <strong>Justin Duke</strong>. (That's me.)

I run <a href="https://buttondown.email">Buttondown</a> and <a href="https://spoonbill.io">Spoonbill</a>. Before that, I spent four years at <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, where I did things like:

<ul>
<li>building <a href="https://stripe.com/sigma">data products</a> into mature lines of business</li>
<li>managing reporting infrastructure & components used by hundreds of thousands of merchants</li>
<li>running and scaling Stripe's Product Quality initiative</li>
</ul>

I also have a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/itstellybelly/">very nice Corgi puppy</a> and mentor aspiring technologists in partnership with <a href="https://www.un-loop.org/">Unloop</a>. With what precious time remains, I generally am either playing video games with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/burtonhf/">my fianc√©</a>, watching basketball, or writing for this very web site.
