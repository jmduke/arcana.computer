There were some redeeming bits here: the central characters are roman a clef ciphers but pleasant ones; the Office of Road Inquiry (and faint feline mysticism); the shadows of dread. But the general framing device is just so rote. Nothing was surprising; nothing was revelatory. It was a very pleasant picture book with a bit of surrealism and I did not come away from the experience re-examining myself.","dictionary":["recKdTdN2oyzB88eL"],"id":"recR0LAngrUIG9CCy"},{"name":"The Devil Wears Prada","type":"Movie","rating":7,"date":"2020-10-30","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recaaMtNmlpvp2lJe"],"image":[{"id":"attRX3ang9DybmV0e","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/8659f22e37db930dee8b26545429e025/45ac0b69/0D5D53AF-9AA3-4ABF-B2C6-55A7198F0F29.jpeg","filename":"0D5D53AF-9AA3-4ABF-B2C6-55A7198F0F29.jpeg","size":59868,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a790f25bf0a19f8db657357bcb547503/0a74de84","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/567918b3ec4310c0227b3889317e9778/71f4bc1f","width":220,"height":325},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/27c81653b21cbccfdc5c47d2056641dc/cac3c585","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"id":"recXWGmdAxqD52RIb"}],"id":"recaaMtNmlpvp2lJe"},{"date":"2020-10-29","content":[{"name":"Baba Is You","type":"Game","console":["Switch"],"dates_consumed":["recfrIl4uL61j9VZb","recV7H981TJ57jOrL","recdzAzV1DwBoCTSh","recb1p89oZ7Td29yg","recumLg9RMPHsdm0V","recAJhlg5LCA6yYXO","recxqks0KFR7yQt44","recklOmHCrgOfodec","rec29UQPqupxWQlkG","recaaMtNmlpvp2lJe","rec6n6Ij9IWG5NTBU","recqcuoAPhyj6sKDF"],"i_own_this?":true,"currently":["recLrSNQERZpV7RaR"],"id":"recGQYvCshAN8aTNa"}],"id":"rec29UQPqupxWQlkG"},{"date":"2020-10-28","content":[{"name":"Persona 4 Golden","type":"Game","console":["PlayStation 2"],"dates_consumed":["reciyBZo8unaCjl6c","recUtmBpdC8IG6S2R","reccVawwhnQ5rJqEG","recp2RiQ5zhevmC84","recupIx9rVmwRp5Do","reclrXX84kWSY24wg","reczq0is5YlSqKAlk","recMkzdCy3k0gKvK4","rec1G7eU7NW0q4pP6","recvVYWjBb3ELwUSM","recpdVFvLrTDMVNj7","recFuvQn4bCHoiLVa","rec8DuxHDRa0hS04I"],"i_own_this?":true,"group":"Persona","id":"recLbjcBWk3b3qAIH"},{"name":"The End of Policing","type":"Book","rating":9,"date":"2020-10-28","author":"Alex Vitale","year":"2019","dates_consumed":["recbaQeGplbpPYhFz","recAA3o9UTBNATWSX","rec9k8ZdpO6Xthkq7","recY1652tS38ltzTO","recxqks0KFR7yQt44","recklOmHCrgOfodec","recATIEx6YZtXfaih","reccVawwhnQ5rJqEG","recp2RiQ5zhevmC84"],"image":[{"id":"attvnCRPI4bUziSgm","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/635ac8a8103d001e6a0a06ca930d2592/b00bc1dc/0D51E5F3-BBAE-4EE8-A6C1-2E359D2EB2AD.jpeg","filename":"0D51E5F3-BBAE-4EE8-A6C1-2E359D2EB2AD.jpeg","size":338119,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fdb89ff55a085054f70e054931a456d1/fd790866","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/8342c4bea76622e8e7e4ad01c9c9aa42/51c167df","width":512,"height":763},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/54f972b5af58bd8676c2a87df6a952d5/da44e04b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book is really good, and I kind of wish it had a different cover.\n\nThis book primes you to think that it is about the gestalt of policing, that it is a rhetorical argument against the police state. \n\nAnd in a lot of ways, it builds to that!

If you are ever looking for a book in which the author tells you exactly what everything means and what everyone is thinking and how you should feel about what everyone is thinking, this is the book.\n\nThere are some nice parts, and I am being uncharitable. The core conceit — a human bank robber — is pleasant and feels ripped from _Bandit_; the characters slowly grow from outright caricatures to _sweet_ outright caricatures (who feel like they'd belong in a Wes Anderson joint, but like, one of the less-regarded ones).\n\nThe writing has some nice moments but is comically saccharine. The author's voice considers themselves authoritatively clever while not actually saying anything particularly clever (an affliction I myself am well-familiar with, from personal experience). I don't think I was surprised by anything the book espoused. \n\nI would pass on this book, though you could do worse for an airport read.","notebook":["recuw4Z66gAFs9mIE"],"source":"Westley Schrack","id":"recjQjvzapJT6HqQQ"}],"id":"recp2RiQ5zhevmC84"},{"date":"2020-10-27","content":[{"name":"Persona 4 Golden","type":"Game","console":["PlayStation 2"],"dates_consumed":["reciyBZo8unaCjl6c","recUtmBpdC8IG6S2R","reccVawwhnQ5rJqEG","recp2RiQ5zhevmC84","recupIx9rVmwRp5Do","reclrXX84kWSY24wg","reczq0is5YlSqKAlk","recMkzdCy3k0gKvK4","rec1G7eU7NW0q4pP6","recvVYWjBb3ELwUSM","recpdVFvLrTDMVNj7","recFuvQn4bCHoiLVa","rec8DuxHDRa0hS04I"],"i_own_this?":true,"group":"Persona","id":"recLbjcBWk3b3qAIH"},{"name":"The End of Policing","type":"Book","rating":9,"date":"2020-10-28","author":"Alex Vitale","year":"2019","dates_consumed":["recbaQeGplbpPYhFz","recAA3o9UTBNATWSX","rec9k8ZdpO6Xthkq7","recY1652tS38ltzTO","recxqks0KFR7yQt44","recklOmHCrgOfodec","recATIEx6YZtXfaih","reccVawwhnQ5rJqEG","recp2RiQ5zhevmC84"],"image":[{"id":"attvnCRPI4bUziSgm","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/635ac8a8103d001e6a0a06ca930d2592/b00bc1dc/0D51E5F3-BBAE-4EE8-A6C1-2E359D2EB2AD.jpeg","filename":"0D51E5F3-BBAE-4EE8-A6C1-2E359D2EB2AD.jpeg","size":338119,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fdb89ff55a085054f70e054931a456d1/fd790866","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/8342c4bea76622e8e7e4ad01c9c9aa42/51c167df","width":512,"height":763},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/54f972b5af58bd8676c2a87df6a952d5/da44e04b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book is really good, and I kind of wish it had a different cover.\n\nThis book primes you to think that it is about the gestalt of policing, that it is a rhetorical argument against the police state. \n\nAnd in a lot of ways, it builds to that!

(This is one of those statements that seems impossible to contradict; I am sure there are people who have only seen the movies and they enjoyed this one, but I don’t know of any.)\n\nSo if the movie’s goal was to transmute a thrilling and satisfying ending to the books onto the screen, I think it did a really good job.

Not colossally low — I loved the Neapolitan Novels! — but relatively low.\n\nAnd I think the book more or less bore that out. There were aspects in which it outshone those novels: I think the portrayal of youth, of budding sexuality and the sense of anagnorisis that all children go through as they learn of their parents is much more vivid and true-ringing than the childhood depicted in her more famous work.\n\nBut the book felt minor and shallow in so many respects compared to its famous siblings. Gone is the rich, beautiful, and terrifying depictions of Naples; gone is the sense of time and evolution that a reader witnesses. What's left is almost a Murakami-esque procession of plot points and themes — sure, Ferrante talks about the difference between order and justice, sure, Ferrante talks about the blinding madness of love, sure, Ferrante talks about the pain of beauty and the pain of gender — but you have heard these things before, and you do not mind hearing them again but you are not blown away by them.","notebook":["recefNtdglzVU43zN"],"dictionary":["recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"],"id":"recwQCkOE2wdVVbMG"},{"name":"Piranesi","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-10-13","author":"Susanna Clarke","genre":["Audiobook"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["recjU3VBf6vzf5KYP","recdoPRKZuJx8LjGY","recDZiJukXnf93QuF","recBOfYFZibz5SevR","recKEQgqR7sfi5mZY","recHn03mZoej7v5sx","recTWFDd3N7aqNXak"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attvRR44mrzti3rux","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9e04f13299950e11b3ab486d99067b3a/1e9bb6e7/piranesi.jpg","filename":"piranesi.jpg","size":31572,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/567a7bd6ea6df054f643d8334f00f868/974ccd1b","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/39dfb678800287c7a5f23df8e4f7b34b/a23f4393","width":331,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5aef0db5c469feb91d8d61072e0efcbd/110d26f7","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"There's a lot to like about this book.

It’s a legitimate contender for GOTY, and deservedly so. The game is interesting, fun, and succeeds at everything that it sets out to do. If I were to try and sum up its victories in a few points, here’s what I’d start with:\n\n- Weapon and build variation mean that characters feel much different within minutes of each run.\n- The core gameplay loop sits at around thirty minutes, which is perfect.\n- Story progression (which fits perfectly within the framing device of the game) is tied to death, so you look forward to losses as opposed to the common roguelike feeling of “well, jeez, that was a waste.”\n- Metaprogression (both in terms of your character getting stronger between runs and the difficulty scaling up in the postgame) is incredibly smooth and elegant.\n\nThe plot, setting, voicing, and art direction are all just really good and, again, tie in extremely well with the story. I’m at a loss to say what can be improved about it: the runs started feeling a little repetitive towards the end, and some of the currency/story unlocking is stingy, but it’s just an incredibly good game and one that I look forward to playing more of down the line.\n\n...So why isn't it a 10? Because it didn't consume my life, I guess. The two most recent 10/10 games I played were CrossCode and Slay The Spire, both of which I daydreamed about and spent shower time thinking about and never wanted to end.

But, fair or not, I ascribe so much of the Socratic structure \u0026 cutesy novelistic flourishes to _The Phoenix Project_ that clearly originated in this book, and I think the writing of the spiritual successor — at least in terms of the setting, the characters involved, and such — rang more true there (or perhaps I just feel more at home in an IT background than a manufacturing plant one.)\n\nThis book was better on two fronts: I think the weird bits about the protagonist's personal life felt a little more germane to the core conflict, and the guru-character (Jonah in this book) was less of an obnoxious jackass. From a purely didactic standpoint, though, I got lost a bit as the book scaled up in abstractions, whereas I think TPP did a very good job there.","notebook":["recILf7Qn7yltMDzw"],"id":"recVjkuQ6Lr3r9kSo"},{"name":"No Filter","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-10-07","author":"Sarah Frier","genre":["Audiobook"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["recp7pJtlwziFpIrp","recLyVBBCLkjTk46p","recBd51Uc2ETyh3XG","recUTpWyAjbEWjhbF","recUERkkRjMkaJST3","recBlbPZlMYOi8Ljc","recPstw21DAnzmQFl","rec3FxZWREgU9J0kF","recjU3VBf6vzf5KYP"],"image":[{"id":"attZP0MKtOrd4bCa9","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/157ac7843252b3438da60fc9e32bd23f/7fc28370/nofilter.jpg","filename":"nofilter.jpg","size":19432,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1dd922f47c121e03e9ab4988ef2a249d/a46fa0cf","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7a9248ec9dd769c052d8853e23ddedbe/9af79977","width":331,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7e949d9b5883a120e63956b5ce024189/0604d687","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A pleasant and uncontroversial read; it is not the exciting tell-all that Bad Blood or to a lesser extent Super Pumped was, but I think its lack of emphasis on _drama_ gave it a more sober lens with which to view Instagram's transformation.

Not colossally low — I loved the Neapolitan Novels! — but relatively low.\n\nAnd I think the book more or less bore that out. There were aspects in which it outshone those novels: I think the portrayal of youth, of budding sexuality and the sense of anagnorisis that all children go through as they learn of their parents is much more vivid and true-ringing than the childhood depicted in her more famous work.\n\nBut the book felt minor and shallow in so many respects compared to its famous siblings. Gone is the rich, beautiful, and terrifying depictions of Naples; gone is the sense of time and evolution that a reader witnesses. What's left is almost a Murakami-esque procession of plot points and themes — sure, Ferrante talks about the difference between order and justice, sure, Ferrante talks about the blinding madness of love, sure, Ferrante talks about the pain of beauty and the pain of gender — but you have heard these things before, and you do not mind hearing them again but you are not blown away by them.","notebook":["recefNtdglzVU43zN"],"dictionary":["recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"],"id":"recwQCkOE2wdVVbMG"},{"name":"Fall Guys","dates_consumed":["recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","reccXWMioAiBEH1Qo"],"id":"rec3fV9SkwB1Qcryb"},{"name":"The Art of Raising a Puppy","dates_consumed":["rec6EkNipprscCCz8","recUoPLJVF27sQnJ6","reccXWMioAiBEH1Qo"],"dictionary":["recZQJe7IYFapo4bJ"],"id":"recPmwxYZ4r6d1N5S"}],"id":"reccXWMioAiBEH1Qo"},{"date":"2020-09-18","content":[{"name":"The Goal","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-09-29","author":"Eliyahu M.

The cast is universally less interesting (with the exception of Fields, who I thought played her role superbly); the script is more muddled; the set pieces comically unrealistic.\n\nBut it also compared favorably in a few respects! The pacing of the film is, on the whole, better (it helps that it's forty minutes leaner!); the climactic showdown in the erstwhile hotel, while grandoise in true Bond fashion, was dramatic in a way that I don't think Casino Royale ever hit. And the general theme of the movie — Bond as an out-of-control widower — works having freshly seen the denoument of the previous film.\n\nIt's not, like, a _good_ film.

The cast is great and the setting \u0026 plot is superb, but I couldn't help having two ornery thoughts, somewhat commingled:\n\n- How is this thing _two and a half hours long_?\n- Why do the action sequences need to be _this long_?\n\nThere's probably a taut, superior version of this movie that clocks in at a hundred minutes. But it's still the most vivid realization of what Bond movies are or can be (barring Skyfall's slightly meta turn).","id":"recj23hWdsuc5882k"},{"name":"The Phoenix Project","type":"Book","rating":9,"date":"2020-09-15","author":"Gene Kim","year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec3u4veSBdrQCGGz","rec0M4LgjkYcxAhL8","rec6EkNipprscCCz8","recgTPVlod4yPf2X2","rec16rKhNnze07t6C"],"image":[{"id":"attbrb4fKV3Aa0KF1","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6b978c2328152d5c46698227f6d8b67d/01057386/phoenix.webp","filename":"phoenix.webp","size":7176,"type":"image/webp","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5ace3b71d8b221de723bd2cd41c8f99a/ee38b441.png","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/35b7d781525cce890ea3b1f2f05cf9fa/5bbd75dd.png","width":197,"height":293},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9978af00f4ce9a5b2209f58b875c3e6f/dafcab4f.png","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book is terrific at a conceptual level. It is absolutely a didactic non-fiction book about management (you could say it's a book about IT or a book about DevOps but it examines both topics through the lens of managements) set in a fictional setting — you follow an IT manager who gets promoted out of his depth as he fights fires over the course of a few months.\n\nNow, the prose isn't good. The characters are largely either caricatures or roadblocks; the trials and tribulations are just-so and elide the tricky details in favor of obvious messages and takeaways. But this book is _so much better_ than it could have been: it was readable and digestible specifically because it uses narrative rather than a list of commandments.\n\nIt apparently stole this style [and admits to doing so!] from _The Goal_, which I've added next to my list.

But I certainly wouldn't pay for it.","notebook":["recWnCp3kvG6g1ect"],"source":"Freia Lobo","isbn":"9780525641780","id":"recc5Rx3TES0LQ70i"},{"name":"Better Living Through Criticism","type":"Book","dates_consumed":["recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recEsQHoAT7HejQeQ","rec22u10UGa4EAPEC"],"dictionary":["recRlLCdPsPoQWDFs"],"id":"recViKyQo9j460F6i"},{"name":"Vectors","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-09-09","author":"James Richardson","genre":["Poetry"],"year":"2012","dates_consumed":["rec22u10UGa4EAPEC","recz3TRaFMb0Z9soL","recMdsLdQdjXL4T6B"],"image":[{"id":"attMKlxTUICLp9D49","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9bc878c5d9d94895b47ecf2b0db3293f/35b59f54/jr.jpeg","filename":"jr.jpeg","size":12448,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/680244dde4dc179317a14774196811eb/6b96252c","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5b259c07612bc1a246a439fd29b58144/98228ac2","width":179,"height":281},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b523e68cde405304e0158a72ea3f30a9/9c757f16","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Hmm.\n\nI am both a sucker and a critic of this genre of aphorism/poetry/short-essay format: I loved _300 Arguments_ even as I hate, well, the vast universe of tweet-sized thought leadership.

(Ah, and the music was good.)\n\nBut — and maybe it is unfair to say this, to view this film through a 2020 lens — parts of it were just gross! I can ignore the foreshadowing of Allen writing about a man who leaves his wife for a family member, sure, but everything Michael Caine touched in this movie felt despicable. I am okay with him portraying a flawed husband, but his chemistry with every single other character feels pained and alien, and his perspective affords no sympathy.\n\nIf I wanted a vaguely misogynist and beautiful film, I'd watch Midnight in Paris; if I wanted something sweet and a little mournful, I'd rewatch Radio Days.

A little short (a friend and I maxed out co-op in two weeks), but really enjoyable!\n\nOne of the things that I think Diablo III does very cleverly (and that is now part of the genre, at least based on reading up on Path of Exile) is that they _recognize_ the fun part of the game is the power creep and going from level 1 to being a whirlwind of carnage, which is why they've set up a seasonal system: every few months, all of your characters get wiped from online (moved strictly to offline so you don't _lose_ anything), and you restart in the exact same game except with a couple season-specific tweaks and bonuses (extra treasure goblins, say, or more critical hits.) It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"}],"id":"recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"},{"date":"2020-09-02","content":[{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Seattle City of Literature","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-08-21","author":"Ryan Boudinot","year":"2015","dates_consumed":["recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recAsxxjrGYNjrC6f","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F"],"image":[{"id":"attAE7a7aDTNqcJul","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ba80198af11db426037b53ccf265428a/cbeca120/scl.jpg","filename":"scl.jpg","size":38129,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7e0141ec6da2d6f48b9cce962b3cb4ea/12a3120a","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9676e742bd8e17ef1e34c2bf99999a3e/1b0beeef","width":367,"height":499},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7cbc7ea512ca580cf0c3cfc848d74b9f/b926784c","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"The book is repetitive but warm: stories generally fall neatly into the following templates:\n\n- I started taking this creative writing class at the UW and it changed my life;\n- I moved to Seattle on a whim because I was bored and it changed my life;\n- I went to this book reading or poetry recital and it changed my life.\n\nWhat I found nice and pleasant about this book (and neither of these things really warrant recommending it to folks) is that so many of the classes, landmarks, and dive bars referenced are places that I've either been to or can imagine going to, and that so many of the stories seem shockingly plausible and livable. \n\nThe revealing nature of this is that the stories of the scene blooming forty years ago are identical to the stories of the scene blooming eighty years ago, and of the scene blooming today.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so. It can be a slog, but it is rewarding.","notebook":["recYfVN9rcm5gA9jz","recRP5dV50yomKU74","recmrqPqv7TztINbe","recKr8dJ40wVQXj1D","recbWyfQC2xsuFvrE","rec9t6PXwRnS2xW3M","reccJkPIcYFkBPXAg","rectKeQVkqKrLe700"],"source":"Byrne Hobart","isbn":"9781441778208","dictionary":["recuVV49Cb3v7Jlvx","recOKLvDouHcBDTo2","recc2F0rjCTRUnKIu"],"id":"recn1HpznDbe5fXeX"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Rocket League","type":"Game","rating":9,"console":["Switch"],"dates_consumed":["recWTn3tUm9Rl8ccm","recQ3g25HCnZj4LJr","rechVa02G6hcEK2sI","recuews4cWhUBR8FH","rec7wr6R9KfnoIja3","recotd8BDy8WXw6SM","rec0QXsUEBS3r25is","rec4u8sq1wsGRdjd5","recHgSb40bIGEtWoX","recTJ56nAdS4Xziro","recmg9MZKrWzzllC1","rec51AXHOlKkCDBoW","rec3K6rOEcxswofiQ","recSqtJVmLvZnbEZp","recVGXCAkVtbgP1Z1","rec4r4lupOdhw26Co","reckQzGjszdcYrM4j","recue32TFUQC1IsKh","recuQ9DOVgeeGKQnO","rec832hX55W6C6TIB","recoQsjimjWZJRrS1","recaBZjvtgNLMB1qi","recSmClY8j2J0RvkN","recU7JyEnYXpqoP4H","recrjrWPVAiSyN9f4","recy8V7I3noiB1Hpr","recDNTmitHAKe2vxL","recaKSXa3hb4ZmaHJ","recqcUdviAqkIATuv","recAizkMJNfYDv3Q4","recmqRB57vXinuclN","recFjlXlCz1uvCTls","recB2SnnfPfAMBzFf","recNqJe8W2hiGvu1M","rec34xZq7n8Tx9514","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recEsQHoAT7HejQeQ","recU3NlNP9TMJsJz8"],"i_own_this?":true,"id":"rec7xSg1HnPfn9g88"}],"id":"recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu"},{"date":"2020-08-14","content":[{"name":"Kokoro","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-08-18","author":"Natsume Sōseki","year":"1914","dates_consumed":["recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recypZKu3dUx6fQjU","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt"],"image":[{"id":"atttmNeXMTIzOhBe7","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/06e2a037c545361eebb8c071fbc955d3/c605c555/kokoro.jpg","filename":"kokoro.jpg","size":21014,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/badf37d1b48d3d81f2172fb0d340c678/c5e171db","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cfff4d16fa33c4d937623dd7a3d3c8f6/d47a9b77","width":220,"height":341},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6fc2e669afd5e166cbeeed4de819785c/e2194261","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I thought this was great, and much more serious than the first part (and the prior reading of [Botchan](/content/botchan)) prepared me, even knowing that the book ended with Sensei's death.\n\nI don't have a lot of specific thoughts, which is odd, because I am thinking _broadly_ about the book.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"The City We Became","dates_consumed":["recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recgTPVlod4yPf2X2","rec3FxZWREgU9J0kF","rec7l3fwlyTTEeshM","recxqks0KFR7yQt44","recqcuoAPhyj6sKDF","reclrXX84kWSY24wg"],"dictionary":["recEIqgoydqo6ghYm","rectECiGrILV2LbSx","recwT5YzYeDYHbVQQ","rec5aTJcZeYLHyrxa","recagXp9T2pPhlaQq"],"id":"recZ1HoXDOQpP6wJt"}],"id":"rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk"},{"date":"2020-08-08","content":[{"name":"CrossCode","type":"Game","rating":10,"date":"2020-08-08","genre":["JRPG"],"console":["macOS"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec8TQ67rOjA41sSd","rec1esEukvVhfjMXh","recNTWTNRu2sbUHM8","reczh3u8gupvKrvK3","recOKTQJVXqDmVzbr","rec8KEpq9AuyolUXm","reczxuutwiWuMKqA3","rec4UcZNTi4OxNABq","recp9MIUxIp3P0PMp","recleSlOShZhdo3lN","rec3NcJyLf8kCSTPg","receyTkRWQJyibOKS","recrPS3a9pfOsExAQ","rec5N4EnKjqE3DBbN","recfrIl4uL61j9VZb","reccfeN0qhLxxmLzY","recRcavpgx6PdAlFg","rec9GLk7JJgcPw1xa","reczLLccjOWumGUTt","recXpKjxAjLIdoFEI","recV7H981TJ57jOrL","recdzAzV1DwBoCTSh","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recvvDMjzhP7dxCMp","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn","recUVfVmPkQQqwVsy","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recUZST3o7eGWerrE","rec7f8ImAvxctyFob","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recP3qyjCY7JKBRfK","recaMkG94tkJB4vnM","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recPALLJicoeBh8PN","rec1dGzSscsiwUM2y","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attwvqcpOSkU2XiTZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6fd6ddf5293703fdcc6e700cd7d00a34/6b6b5912/2020-08-0814.33.06.jpg","filename":"2020-08-08 14.33.06.jpg","size":917989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dcb4a4ec4c9a891e6192555680e5d026/70977689","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5f8ad9aced9ed0bf11701465047e00b8/f9e96ac8","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bd5f50b5b15f342a8f9437c72e46b705/00afcbbe","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Okay, the game has flaws. \n\nIt’s overtuned and overstuffed; dungeons should be half the length, a third of the quests should be removed, and the challenge is clearly calibrated for folks who have spent three years on the engine. (I call this “early access syndrome” — releasing to passionate beta users both gives you the privilege of adding a bunch of new content because it’s easy and you don’t have the time pressure, plus it means you’re building content for experienced players rather than novices.)\n\nThe middle third of the game (everything surrounding Gaia’s Garden, basically) is rough and frustrating and caused me to quit the game once and put it down a second time.\n\nBut, man.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Earthlock","type":"Game","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recVy19Yjtfcrltsx"],"id":"recNErwBNh43DvX6j"},{"name":"Fall Guys","dates_consumed":["recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","reccXWMioAiBEH1Qo"],"id":"rec3fV9SkwB1Qcryb"},{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe.

I think about the particular love the protagonist has for Sensei, and how this border between love and idolatry is largely unexplored in Western literature I've read.  I think about, of course, [Hark!

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so. It can be a slog, but it is rewarding.","notebook":["recYfVN9rcm5gA9jz","recRP5dV50yomKU74","recmrqPqv7TztINbe","recKr8dJ40wVQXj1D","recbWyfQC2xsuFvrE","rec9t6PXwRnS2xW3M","reccJkPIcYFkBPXAg","rectKeQVkqKrLe700"],"source":"Byrne Hobart","isbn":"9781441778208","dictionary":["recuVV49Cb3v7Jlvx","recOKLvDouHcBDTo2","recc2F0rjCTRUnKIu"],"id":"recn1HpznDbe5fXeX"}],"id":"recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr"},{"date":"2020-07-31","content":[{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

A little short (a friend and I maxed out co-op in two weeks), but really enjoyable!\n\nOne of the things that I think Diablo III does very cleverly (and that is now part of the genre, at least based on reading up on Path of Exile) is that they _recognize_ the fun part of the game is the power creep and going from level 1 to being a whirlwind of carnage, which is why they've set up a seasonal system: every few months, all of your characters get wiped from online (moved strictly to offline so you don't _lose_ anything), and you restart in the exact same game except with a couple season-specific tweaks and bonuses (extra treasure goblins, say, or more critical hits.) It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"}],"id":"recLLet6h1M4qIdqo"},{"date":"2020-07-29","content":[{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more.

Hold down buttons and watch demons explode and numbers go up.  A little short (a friend and I maxed out co-op in two weeks), but really enjoyable!\n\nOne of the things that I think Diablo III does very cleverly (and that is now part of the genre, at least based on reading up on Path of Exile) is that they _recognize_ the fun part of the game is the power creep and going from level 1 to being a whirlwind of carnage, which is why they've set up a seasonal system: every few months, all of your characters get wiped from online (moved strictly to offline so you don't _lose_ anything), and you restart in the exact same game except with a couple season-specific tweaks and bonuses (extra treasure goblins, say, or more critical hits.) It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"}],"id":"recNKzBTp56dYehWr"},{"date":"2020-07-23","content":[{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe. Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so. It can be a slog, but it is rewarding.","notebook":["recYfVN9rcm5gA9jz","recRP5dV50yomKU74","recmrqPqv7TztINbe","recKr8dJ40wVQXj1D","recbWyfQC2xsuFvrE","rec9t6PXwRnS2xW3M","reccJkPIcYFkBPXAg","rectKeQVkqKrLe700"],"source":"Byrne Hobart","isbn":"9781441778208","dictionary":["recuVV49Cb3v7Jlvx","recOKLvDouHcBDTo2","recc2F0rjCTRUnKIu"],"id":"recn1HpznDbe5fXeX"},{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"CrossCode","type":"Game","rating":10,"date":"2020-08-08","genre":["JRPG"],"console":["macOS"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec8TQ67rOjA41sSd","rec1esEukvVhfjMXh","recNTWTNRu2sbUHM8","reczh3u8gupvKrvK3","recOKTQJVXqDmVzbr","rec8KEpq9AuyolUXm","reczxuutwiWuMKqA3","rec4UcZNTi4OxNABq","recp9MIUxIp3P0PMp","recleSlOShZhdo3lN","rec3NcJyLf8kCSTPg","receyTkRWQJyibOKS","recrPS3a9pfOsExAQ","rec5N4EnKjqE3DBbN","recfrIl4uL61j9VZb","reccfeN0qhLxxmLzY","recRcavpgx6PdAlFg","rec9GLk7JJgcPw1xa","reczLLccjOWumGUTt","recXpKjxAjLIdoFEI","recV7H981TJ57jOrL","recdzAzV1DwBoCTSh","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recvvDMjzhP7dxCMp","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn","recUVfVmPkQQqwVsy","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recUZST3o7eGWerrE","rec7f8ImAvxctyFob","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recP3qyjCY7JKBRfK","recaMkG94tkJB4vnM","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recPALLJicoeBh8PN","rec1dGzSscsiwUM2y","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attwvqcpOSkU2XiTZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6fd6ddf5293703fdcc6e700cd7d00a34/6b6b5912/2020-08-0814.33.06.jpg","filename":"2020-08-08 14.33.06.jpg","size":917989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dcb4a4ec4c9a891e6192555680e5d026/70977689","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5f8ad9aced9ed0bf11701465047e00b8/f9e96ac8","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bd5f50b5b15f342a8f9437c72e46b705/00afcbbe","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Okay, the game has flaws. \n\nIt’s overtuned and overstuffed; dungeons should be half the length, a third of the quests should be removed, and the challenge is clearly calibrated for folks who have spent three years on the engine.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe.

It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"}],"id":"recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp"},{"date":"2020-07-21","content":[{"name":"CrossCode","type":"Game","rating":10,"date":"2020-08-08","genre":["JRPG"],"console":["macOS"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec8TQ67rOjA41sSd","rec1esEukvVhfjMXh","recNTWTNRu2sbUHM8","reczh3u8gupvKrvK3","recOKTQJVXqDmVzbr","rec8KEpq9AuyolUXm","reczxuutwiWuMKqA3","rec4UcZNTi4OxNABq","recp9MIUxIp3P0PMp","recleSlOShZhdo3lN","rec3NcJyLf8kCSTPg","receyTkRWQJyibOKS","recrPS3a9pfOsExAQ","rec5N4EnKjqE3DBbN","recfrIl4uL61j9VZb","reccfeN0qhLxxmLzY","recRcavpgx6PdAlFg","rec9GLk7JJgcPw1xa","reczLLccjOWumGUTt","recXpKjxAjLIdoFEI","recV7H981TJ57jOrL","recdzAzV1DwBoCTSh","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recvvDMjzhP7dxCMp","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn","recUVfVmPkQQqwVsy","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recUZST3o7eGWerrE","rec7f8ImAvxctyFob","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recP3qyjCY7JKBRfK","recaMkG94tkJB4vnM","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recPALLJicoeBh8PN","rec1dGzSscsiwUM2y","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attwvqcpOSkU2XiTZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6fd6ddf5293703fdcc6e700cd7d00a34/6b6b5912/2020-08-0814.33.06.jpg","filename":"2020-08-08 14.33.06.jpg","size":917989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dcb4a4ec4c9a891e6192555680e5d026/70977689","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5f8ad9aced9ed0bf11701465047e00b8/f9e96ac8","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bd5f50b5b15f342a8f9437c72e46b705/00afcbbe","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Okay, the game has flaws. \n\nIt’s overtuned and overstuffed; dungeons should be half the length, a third of the quests should be removed, and the challenge is clearly calibrated for folks who have spent three years on the engine.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"rechx41JxttomNXcf"},{"date":"2020-07-20","content":[{"name":"CrossCode","type":"Game","rating":10,"date":"2020-08-08","genre":["JRPG"],"console":["macOS"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec8TQ67rOjA41sSd","rec1esEukvVhfjMXh","recNTWTNRu2sbUHM8","reczh3u8gupvKrvK3","recOKTQJVXqDmVzbr","rec8KEpq9AuyolUXm","reczxuutwiWuMKqA3","rec4UcZNTi4OxNABq","recp9MIUxIp3P0PMp","recleSlOShZhdo3lN","rec3NcJyLf8kCSTPg","receyTkRWQJyibOKS","recrPS3a9pfOsExAQ","rec5N4EnKjqE3DBbN","recfrIl4uL61j9VZb","reccfeN0qhLxxmLzY","recRcavpgx6PdAlFg","rec9GLk7JJgcPw1xa","reczLLccjOWumGUTt","recXpKjxAjLIdoFEI","recV7H981TJ57jOrL","recdzAzV1DwBoCTSh","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recvvDMjzhP7dxCMp","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn","recUVfVmPkQQqwVsy","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recUZST3o7eGWerrE","rec7f8ImAvxctyFob","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recP3qyjCY7JKBRfK","recaMkG94tkJB4vnM","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recPALLJicoeBh8PN","rec1dGzSscsiwUM2y","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attwvqcpOSkU2XiTZ","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6fd6ddf5293703fdcc6e700cd7d00a34/6b6b5912/2020-08-0814.33.06.jpg","filename":"2020-08-08 14.33.06.jpg","size":917989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dcb4a4ec4c9a891e6192555680e5d026/70977689","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5f8ad9aced9ed0bf11701465047e00b8/f9e96ac8","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bd5f50b5b15f342a8f9437c72e46b705/00afcbbe","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Okay, the game has flaws. \n\nIt’s overtuned and overstuffed; dungeons should be half the length, a third of the quests should be removed, and the challenge is clearly calibrated for folks who have spent three years on the engine.

Hold down buttons and watch demons explode and numbers go up.  A little short (a friend and I maxed out co-op in two weeks), but really enjoyable!\n\nOne of the things that I think Diablo III does very cleverly (and that is now part of the genre, at least based on reading up on Path of Exile) is that they _recognize_ the fun part of the game is the power creep and going from level 1 to being a whirlwind of carnage, which is why they've set up a seasonal system: every few months, all of your characters get wiped from online (moved strictly to offline so you don't _lose_ anything), and you restart in the exact same game except with a couple season-specific tweaks and bonuses (extra treasure goblins, say, or more critical hits.) It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"},{"name":"The City We Became","dates_consumed":["recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recgTPVlod4yPf2X2","rec3FxZWREgU9J0kF","rec7l3fwlyTTEeshM","recxqks0KFR7yQt44","recqcuoAPhyj6sKDF","reclrXX84kWSY24wg"],"dictionary":["recEIqgoydqo6ghYm","rectECiGrILV2LbSx","recwT5YzYeDYHbVQQ","rec5aTJcZeYLHyrxa","recagXp9T2pPhlaQq"],"id":"recZ1HoXDOQpP6wJt"},{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe.

I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.  The most important variable in battle is your level: if you want to do better, level up.  This is so drastically less interesting than a game with parallel grinds (crafting! exploration! arts!) etc, and as soon as you shatter the illusion that all these subsystems actually matter you're left sighing, finding the optimal party to one-hit things with combos, and rushing through the cutscenes.","id":"recRMT5UlMPS8lxlH"},{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Postwar","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-06","author":"Tony Judt","year":"2006","dates_consumed":["recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recdagzrfkCnIFhPU","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recJl5ty7yaTZow0n","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recCRM3SY4U3N8Cqe","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recNc5TOZTdDPwIPu","rec7bFmm2MBTq6akh","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recTs8ehoOIPvTrf1","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recPqklzdltsOPSJL","recoYY7BNkZnMUZtY","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recj0G8WxuB9K83FE","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recG8uuXUwRB7ngdt","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recl0qqbSggYbx548","recEI5JfW7LCndWBx","recBbvUt9BMZTGEz8","recEoVTlXHtTJdplV","recaLrlawFNCJyo3O","recW3AfMzhL3Rr3H4","recRm88H6Sy0J3clM","rechcUIPQbJpRvmif","recNv1r0IM3QYqQXB","recdtxlfV236U7fMe","recC2FLsJHkOo4fRy"],"image":[{"id":"attdKmgvOcdDGsD6y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/be9cc069e59ed0d8dcff4fb29447d1da/7bc2fa72/postwar.jpg","filename":"postwar.jpg","size":649556,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b853be72dc7578e3237b54a301f4a301/d385c11d","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aeb792f4aa806e46d17f9deda0997c39/34dfe531","width":512,"height":779},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/55b7a7b67532337f49e47c2ae6038b1e/47b72443","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Postwar is not a book so much as it is a college course on 20th century Europe. Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so.

It is legitimately very very funny, the history is all accurate, and the metastory of the author's battle with hermitage, depression, and eventual suicide casts an interesting pallor over the entire affair. Cuppy manages to thread an increasing thesis through all of the loosely interconnected tales: powerful figures are flawed in very entertaining, boring, predictable ways, and that historiography fails us in our understanding of them.\n\nBut I just... felt like it dragged.

I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.  The most important variable in battle is your level: if you want to do better, level up.  This is so drastically less interesting than a game with parallel grinds (crafting! exploration! arts!) etc, and as soon as you shatter the illusion that all these subsystems actually matter you're left sighing, finding the optimal party to one-hit things with combos, and rushing through the cutscenes.","id":"recRMT5UlMPS8lxlH"},{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1"},{"date":"2020-07-09","content":[{"name":"The Need to Hold Still","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-07-10","author":"Lisel Mueller","genre":["Poetry"],"year":"1980","dates_consumed":["recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recKcXT62GnFWKahL","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1"],"image":[{"id":"attsZksHups1bNee5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/418d177bdcadf01922256e4f18b5a4b1/cbf0686b/need.jpg","filename":"need.jpg","size":21649,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/050e95c6284be18ce300db2fc8653f9f/bfb04df6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cb1818d05f9f5889713a048413369fc3/6e4efdbe","width":304,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/78917be0f3385638e89da1a40233c676/8d11b1ce","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A couple knock-my-on-my-ass poems that outweigh some of the second-half duds.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recU36cyUjgxc8UCj"},{"date":"2020-07-07","content":[{"name":"Xenoblade Chronicles","type":"Game","rating":6,"date":"2020-07-11","console":["Switch"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["reccj9YEnJ9XRQ3dC","reczsTaXEaJEqKvsl","recKYz2A90oRIBVE3","recOUwWQc6zfd3XO7","recMquFaSSRwgeX0d","recAcToxKduck9Nym","rec8APy6v1tPFu9aP","recTikBd9FkosRUIZ","recZSI79SEMprNF5u","rech5yqywNPBwTrMd","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rec77VEvZixi5R8cd","reclxvbiyLuNEyNhM","recZ5yS1oJmer4p4n","recfQfHGbzbNeFxOJ","recPJ7dpHgvJl3zfc","recnzP6s2utzlKRKW","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recemGeaf43BLnwti","recOvUQF0t3hUEp1q","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq"],"i_own_this?":true,"queue":["recQSUNrrz1c3sHaX"],"image":[{"id":"attKvgMW3r2XWjEa5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c5a98fddc35852bec8f9dcb738abaaaa/37540ae2/xenoblade.jpeg","filename":"xenoblade.jpeg","size":67763,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e1f73d614fd21822b3a91aca86283e1d/615337ed","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/265fc9db9745740adef1e1021b13b84c/3d207f16","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a7d98c9e0d82b620f831f1302195d16f/d3391115","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Hmmm.\n\nOn the one hand, Xenoblade grabbed me really hard.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so.

His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Xenoblade Chronicles","type":"Game","rating":6,"date":"2020-07-11","console":["Switch"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["reccj9YEnJ9XRQ3dC","reczsTaXEaJEqKvsl","recKYz2A90oRIBVE3","recOUwWQc6zfd3XO7","recMquFaSSRwgeX0d","recAcToxKduck9Nym","rec8APy6v1tPFu9aP","recTikBd9FkosRUIZ","recZSI79SEMprNF5u","rech5yqywNPBwTrMd","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rec77VEvZixi5R8cd","reclxvbiyLuNEyNhM","recZ5yS1oJmer4p4n","recfQfHGbzbNeFxOJ","recPJ7dpHgvJl3zfc","recnzP6s2utzlKRKW","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recemGeaf43BLnwti","recOvUQF0t3hUEp1q","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq"],"i_own_this?":true,"queue":["recQSUNrrz1c3sHaX"],"image":[{"id":"attKvgMW3r2XWjEa5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c5a98fddc35852bec8f9dcb738abaaaa/37540ae2/xenoblade.jpeg","filename":"xenoblade.jpeg","size":67763,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e1f73d614fd21822b3a91aca86283e1d/615337ed","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/265fc9db9745740adef1e1021b13b84c/3d207f16","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a7d98c9e0d82b620f831f1302195d16f/d3391115","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Hmmm.\n\nOn the one hand, Xenoblade grabbed me really hard.  I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.  The most important variable in battle is your level: if you want to do better, level up.  This is so drastically less interesting than a game with parallel grinds (crafting! exploration! arts!) etc, and as soon as you shatter the illusion that all these subsystems actually matter you're left sighing, finding the optimal party to one-hit things with combos, and rushing through the cutscenes.","id":"recRMT5UlMPS8lxlH"},{"name":"The White Queen","type":"Television","rating":4,"date":"2020-07-16","year":"2013","dates_consumed":["recnzP6s2utzlKRKW","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn"],"id":"rec3JTWjFmLHxpvWS"}],"id":"recemGeaf43BLnwti"},{"date":"2020-07-02","content":[{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO"},{"date":"2020-06-30","content":[{"name":"Bandit","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-06-30","author":"Molly Brodak","genre":["Personal"],"year":"2016","dates_consumed":["recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recpRjMnvj487t8rK"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"att6oDqbXUQ7pAsUy","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9210b684121bdfc21d773a4882fcd605/bcc42711/molly.jpg","filename":"molly.jpg","size":27140,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/59ffab1b438db2da29b0e82f8fcdf348/2be40f9b","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cf202db72735b71f773c1567c0bfa98d/7e563598","width":328,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/149b59304206ddc326305a7bcb291db6/96166a14","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This is a very good book and equal parts ascent and descent.

I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.  The most important variable in battle is your level: if you want to do better, level up.  This is so drastically less interesting than a game with parallel grinds (crafting! exploration! arts!) etc, and as soon as you shatter the illusion that all these subsystems actually matter you're left sighing, finding the optimal party to one-hit things with combos, and rushing through the cutscenes.","id":"recRMT5UlMPS8lxlH"}],"id":"recpRjMnvj487t8rK"},{"date":"2020-06-29","content":[{"name":"Bandit","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-06-30","author":"Molly Brodak","genre":["Personal"],"year":"2016","dates_consumed":["recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recpRjMnvj487t8rK"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"att6oDqbXUQ7pAsUy","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9210b684121bdfc21d773a4882fcd605/bcc42711/molly.jpg","filename":"molly.jpg","size":27140,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/59ffab1b438db2da29b0e82f8fcdf348/2be40f9b","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cf202db72735b71f773c1567c0bfa98d/7e563598","width":328,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/149b59304206ddc326305a7bcb291db6/96166a14","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This is a very good book and equal parts ascent and descent.

It is an interesting story about a sad family; it is an interesting self-diagnosis and meditation on what we look for in our family; it is a poem about addiction and loss.  (It only drags in one portion, towards the end, as many memoirs tend to do, which is when the tense turns from past to present: Molly walks us through her retracing of her father's steps as she is writing the book, which as often does has the effect of intimating a personal revelation that cannot turn universal.)\n \nBut the thing overshadowing the rest of the narrative, to me, is knowledge of how Molly's life ends the way it does, with suicide. It is hard not to think about her death when she discusses her mother's suicide attempts, or her grappling with disassociation and trauma.\n\nI sat for a while after finishing this book, in the morning, with my partner asleep on my chest, feeling a little lost.  I searched for more about Molly — her cooking blog, her teaching blog.  And then I settled on the poem that brought me to her memoir in the first place:\n\nIn the Morning, Before Anything Bad Happens\n\n\nThe sky is open\nall the way.\n\nWorkers upright on the line\nlike spokes.\n\nI know there is a river somewhere,\nlit, fragrant, golden mist, all that,\n\nwhose irrepressible birds\ncan’t believe their luck this morning\nand every morning.\n\nI let them riot\nin my mind a few minutes more\nbefore the news comes.","notebook":["recF4Eg7v1G4k7vCM","recSTcbUugeaAuoHi","recwhydcOj3DEEGDp","reciuE9kdKqpvkVgG"],"id":"recyqbWz3u7YH19XM"},{"name":"The White Queen","type":"Television","rating":4,"date":"2020-07-16","year":"2013","dates_consumed":["recnzP6s2utzlKRKW","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recRbasj1WOaUqtBc","recQbHLEMMqpjX9Nn"],"id":"rec3JTWjFmLHxpvWS"},{"name":"The Song of Achilles","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-07-05","author":"Madeleine Miller","genre":["Audiobook"],"year":"2011","dates_consumed":["reclxvbiyLuNEyNhM","rec34xZq7n8Tx9514","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recZ5yS1oJmer4p4n","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","recOvUQF0t3hUEp1q","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB"],"summary":"I think I was spoiled by having read Circe first, which seemed like an utter improvement on its predecessor.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Xenoblade Chronicles","type":"Game","rating":6,"date":"2020-07-11","console":["Switch"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["reccj9YEnJ9XRQ3dC","reczsTaXEaJEqKvsl","recKYz2A90oRIBVE3","recOUwWQc6zfd3XO7","recMquFaSSRwgeX0d","recAcToxKduck9Nym","rec8APy6v1tPFu9aP","recTikBd9FkosRUIZ","recZSI79SEMprNF5u","rech5yqywNPBwTrMd","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rec77VEvZixi5R8cd","reclxvbiyLuNEyNhM","recZ5yS1oJmer4p4n","recfQfHGbzbNeFxOJ","recPJ7dpHgvJl3zfc","recnzP6s2utzlKRKW","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recpRjMnvj487t8rK","recemGeaf43BLnwti","recOvUQF0t3hUEp1q","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recvEylzf5iny1b7h","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq"],"i_own_this?":true,"queue":["recQSUNrrz1c3sHaX"],"image":[{"id":"attKvgMW3r2XWjEa5","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c5a98fddc35852bec8f9dcb738abaaaa/37540ae2/xenoblade.jpeg","filename":"xenoblade.jpeg","size":67763,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e1f73d614fd21822b3a91aca86283e1d/615337ed","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/265fc9db9745740adef1e1021b13b84c/3d207f16","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a7d98c9e0d82b620f831f1302195d16f/d3391115","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Hmmm.\n\nOn the one hand, Xenoblade grabbed me really hard.  I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.

There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa"},{"date":"2020-06-10","content":[{"name":"Sister Outsider","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-06-14","author":"Audre Lorde","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction","Essays","Personal"],"year":"1983","dates_consumed":["recZSI79SEMprNF5u","rech5yqywNPBwTrMd","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recdz8sJuqfOBQvpz","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rec77VEvZixi5R8cd"],"image":[{"id":"attL8lo0koKPorBQq","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/627ba5a125aee5f4135dce8cc301c613/0955b817/2020-06-1420.32.52.jpg","filename":"2020-06-14 20.32.52.jpg","size":93325,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/92260133d1334680481e1c00bf4c30d5/60e43780","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b167cb1d72977b0df0774e60f3cafbb2/81755b31","width":333,"height":499},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3627964711da24176c8dfe77012fa8e2/4065e53e","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"The Robin Eller narration was truly awful, but the book was as great as its legacy accords it.

His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"New Super Mario Bros.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Afro Samurai","type":"Television","dates_consumed":["rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE"],"upcoming_television":["rec0k0QwVOzP5MuHt"],"id":"recuFmUVDw2OCXDXl"}],"id":"recA6eZIpdusIzeOE"},{"date":"2020-05-24","content":[{"name":"Utopia of Rules","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-05-30","author":"David Graeber","genre":["Non-Fiction","Audiobook"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["recQph2uli8kVl5Jn","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","rec94lHD8VNPv300X","recWp7kxC7fkAVE3h","rec8LI0MQ3lfSPogB","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","reccj9YEnJ9XRQ3dC"],"summary":"Strictly less interesting and less persuasive than Debt or Bullshit Jobs, with an odd (and admittedly self-aware) discursiveness rather than an actual thesis.","notebook":["recZ6uuiiSoCbfA3s"],"isbn":"9781612193748","id":"reco3ZPwTWpq0LKmC"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the

It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"}],"id":"recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ"},{"date":"2020-05-12","content":[{"name":"Dune","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-20","author":"Frank

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Final Fantasy VII Remake","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-13","console":["PlayStation 4"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recqvrxpAvnJ969va","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i"],"i_own_this?":true,"group":"Final Fantasy","image":[{"id":"attNy2Sc4Guaxzn8G","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5870997b22d2b28c181be43ec373116a/34168ac8/screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","filename":"screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","size":994319,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9da969aab43fe0bea63f8af109f89554/9f652b39","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/32e36dad86ff90e52c03be1effcd7331/67b9af9d","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c9c58f5358a7511b9d9c2b3e748ac72a/21bf088a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I didn't think you could remake a game with twenty years of nostalgia and weight behind it and have it be as good as this was.","id":"reclhgU9aMqdMHHSt"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb"},{"date":"2020-05-10","content":[{"name":"Dune","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-20","author":"Frank Herbert","genre":["Science Fiction","Audiobook"],"year":"1965","dates_consumed":["rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recOyo2Jm4v8JCr6q","recoXxpGmjjNt4c4t","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attwbTimCCpDTPb4A","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/1ba5f3d7bd4f0ac316781478538e04a9/e4013bb3/81BJ3OD3J-L.jpg","filename":"81BJ3OD3J-L.jpg","size":438198,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1ea236c64df59149b3c5bc718c2a5ed8/76ae0339","width":20,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c1a20ce03e3ec63ebcc82a80a630603f/7497f4ac","width":512,"height":917},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f8b91791fba98e78189503444271d1ee/b861aae0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Amazing worldbuilding and terrible characterization, which... seems kind of par for the course considering it's place in the science fiction canon.","id":"recqnyA54WiRh79G6"},{"name":"Final Fantasy VII Remake","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-13","console":["PlayStation 4"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recqvrxpAvnJ969va","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i"],"i_own_this?":true,"group":"Final Fantasy","image":[{"id":"attNy2Sc4Guaxzn8G","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5870997b22d2b28c181be43ec373116a/34168ac8/screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","filename":"screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","size":994319,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9da969aab43fe0bea63f8af109f89554/9f652b39","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/32e36dad86ff90e52c03be1effcd7331/67b9af9d","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c9c58f5358a7511b9d9c2b3e748ac72a/21bf088a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I didn't think you could remake a game with twenty years of nostalgia and weight behind it and have it be as good as this was.","id":"reclhgU9aMqdMHHSt"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Ethics in the Real World","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-09","author":"Peter

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn"},{"date":"2020-05-02","content":[{"name":"Diablo III","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-15","genre":["Hack and Slash"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2013","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL","recUskg9O55o4FgJ1","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","recc9uLg2l27yHZGJ","recisyr9eLTuwkgHm","recLYfQZXVuyhq8aH","reclo7sgLF2dzYVXM","recRKfn4ZXumU32bI","recis2vfzdc7OTlPB","recSkiMuEaXWQyt9g","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recNKzBTp56dYehWr","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recHGAkyy7cQftipB","recLfSaR7wHqGgwoT","recjVJ6UG7JAS0T54","recpRKaH50qDu7Nxn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attM0QQfrN3MXtAYz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ccb87ee677f30dedc33621fbce12fd5a/d4e80773/81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","filename":"81lSSQv99NL._SY445_.jpg","size":37386,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0a884632a9d39e43241991dddd310c81/7df4b7b6","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00c1b6d0c65c8c78d7851b60c5d8ae35/6884216f","width":275,"height":445},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/70b3cbf6ad9e08565e40c56092207bd6/d56443bd","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect brain-smoothing game.  Hold down buttons and watch demons explode and numbers go up.  A little short (a friend and I maxed out co-op in two weeks), but really enjoyable!\n\nOne of the things that I think Diablo III does very cleverly (and that is now part of the genre, at least based on reading up on Path of Exile) is that they _recognize_ the fun part of the game is the power creep and going from level 1 to being a whirlwind of carnage, which is why they've set up a seasonal system: every few months, all of your characters get wiped from online (moved strictly to offline so you don't _lose_ anything), and you restart in the exact same game except with a couple season-specific tweaks and bonuses (extra treasure goblins, say, or more critical hits.) It keeps the game fresh because there's so little to do once you've hit the asymptotic part of the power curve but the journey is more fun than the destination.","id":"recqyAsmEsjGvx0PO"},{"name":"The Fellowship of the Ring","type":"Movie","dates_consumed":["rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP"],"id":"recvPWIbYlL7U7Rgq"},{"name":"Cowboy Bebop","type":"Television","rating":10,"dates_consumed":["recqvrxpAvnJ969va","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","recaUzPjK5ZWFw1iA","rechtqBALWROGF2hN","rec9tp1MQyFPhgG47","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP"],"id":"rec13J8MUYpNuClv1"},{"name":"Ethics in the Real World","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-09","author":"Peter Singer","genre":["Philosophy"],"year":"2017","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","rec5dzZ1ra8F5GTIQ","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attZkwBFzGv2e9xpH","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4ad3e4782ce8404195067af35b5e5295/5e33a4ad/9780691172477.jpgw640","filename":"9780691172477.jpg?w=640","size":173934,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/444d9e769edd5ab8ec8839ecaf4c75c6/097c3070","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b90cfd8a1e754f5b6cf9ab8f079a1be/0af1e06e","width":512,"height":791},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63f3bb031b2579d16d1cf19a1132e395/e166cab4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Cursory essays, generally in a frustrating way but with some great gems.","id":"rec9aGiHSf7EJddDi"}],"id":"rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP"},{"date":"2020-05-01","content":[{"name":"Against the Grain","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-03","author":"James Scott","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attpH5OXVgCIZwO3V","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/19da395676ca620bfe3136b3f4a3920a/e10c2c0b/61xCjasW1pL.jpg","filename":"61xCjasW1pL.jpg","size":73804,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/400a1d5f36887a60a22c8e83c0ef6e71/7bdccf30","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c264de918d0d3474b7c43497fa7e9f15/79cb05ad","width":512,"height":768},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3963dc95d2743d9ce1922a9bf1388c0f/1e7ee75a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This was a lot of fun, and I think a better and more persuasive book (largely due to its focus) than Seeing Like A State.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Against the Grain","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-03","author":"James Scott","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attpH5OXVgCIZwO3V","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/19da395676ca620bfe3136b3f4a3920a/e10c2c0b/61xCjasW1pL.jpg","filename":"61xCjasW1pL.jpg","size":73804,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/400a1d5f36887a60a22c8e83c0ef6e71/7bdccf30","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c264de918d0d3474b7c43497fa7e9f15/79cb05ad","width":512,"height":768},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3963dc95d2743d9ce1922a9bf1388c0f/1e7ee75a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This was a lot of fun, and I think a better and more persuasive book (largely due to its focus) than Seeing Like A State.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Ethics in the Real World","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-09","author":"Peter Singer","genre":["Philosophy"],"year":"2017","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","rec5dzZ1ra8F5GTIQ","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attZkwBFzGv2e9xpH","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4ad3e4782ce8404195067af35b5e5295/5e33a4ad/9780691172477.jpgw640","filename":"9780691172477.jpg?w=640","size":173934,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/444d9e769edd5ab8ec8839ecaf4c75c6/097c3070","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b90cfd8a1e754f5b6cf9ab8f079a1be/0af1e06e","width":512,"height":791},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63f3bb031b2579d16d1cf19a1132e395/e166cab4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Cursory essays, generally in a frustrating way but with some great gems.","id":"rec9aGiHSf7EJddDi"},{"name":"Pokemon Shield","type":"Game","rating":5,"date":"2020-04-28","genre":["JRPG"],"console":["Switch"],"year":"2019","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","rec5dzZ1ra8F5GTIQ","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","recFRkHqZB2lrPcGu","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recrM3A5umwcKrZuZ","recypZKu3dUx6fQjU","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F"],"image":[{"id":"attwPj95r2BNnElpc","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/863fa73f8cfd4a016838ae5e9c5b2778/31a7ff99/71lz62-F84L._SY550_.jpg","filename":"71lz62-F84L._SY550_.jpg","size":48989,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cbcc50f014e16d7d653feb655fb1f663/d696a32e","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/768d3d49956548d428fe3bcfb586298f/f54fb46f","width":340,"height":550},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3cdb9235ebfdeba0e9da6b171fec5f14/168701f3","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I found this game both objectively bad and unchallenging (discounting the metagame, which I don't dabble in) and also weirdly enchanting.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong.

His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Ethics in the Real World","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-09","author":"Peter Singer","genre":["Philosophy"],"year":"2017","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","rec5dzZ1ra8F5GTIQ","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attZkwBFzGv2e9xpH","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4ad3e4782ce8404195067af35b5e5295/5e33a4ad/9780691172477.jpgw640","filename":"9780691172477.jpg?w=640","size":173934,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/444d9e769edd5ab8ec8839ecaf4c75c6/097c3070","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b90cfd8a1e754f5b6cf9ab8f079a1be/0af1e06e","width":512,"height":791},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63f3bb031b2579d16d1cf19a1132e395/e166cab4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Cursory essays, generally in a frustrating way but with some great gems.","id":"rec9aGiHSf7EJddDi"},{"name":"Cowboy Bebop","type":"Television","rating":10,"dates_consumed":["recqvrxpAvnJ969va","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","recaUzPjK5ZWFw1iA","rechtqBALWROGF2hN","rec9tp1MQyFPhgG47","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP"],"id":"rec13J8MUYpNuClv1"}],"id":"recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o"},{"date":"2020-04-12","content":[{"name":"The Thin Man","type":"Movie","rating":9,"date":"2020-04-12","year":"1934","dates_consumed":["reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8"],"image":[{"id":"attJSJSnYqhI5Oyn7","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c44b37e01427194bc30f521303afe7f/89a8e419/51I7CYnw3kL._AC_.jpg","filename":"51I7CYnw3kL._AC_.jpg","size":29032,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b08a475152256467f09809d65bcc06ee/39f357c3","width":25,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5538d72d1f679a177940d62c1e651a2b/02830e5e","width":338,"height":487},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/6850d34f788b2536425d4f30424df8ad/382d13f0","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"inspired by my recent acquisition of nick and nora glasses: this was just....delightful?

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recmx5yQAdiKepWcD"},{"date":"2020-04-03","content":[{"name":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons","type":"Game","console":["Switch"],"dates_consumed":["recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","recfTDIOzhEyu3kBW","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","rec6uO13Kxfkdgon8","recRS9CJ1Vl1MBF4R","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","rechx7UstyEBIR9Bk"],"i_own_this?":true,"id":"rec23ELgutsNjRzQt"}],"id":"rec6uO13Kxfkdgon8"},{"date":"2020-04-02","content":[{"name":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons","type":"Game","console":["Switch"],"dates_consumed":["recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","recfTDIOzhEyu3kBW","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","rec6uO13Kxfkdgon8","recRS9CJ1Vl1MBF4R","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","rechx7UstyEBIR9Bk"],"i_own_this?":true,"id":"rec23ELgutsNjRzQt"}],"id":"recRS9CJ1Vl1MBF4R"},{"date":"2020-04-01","content":[{"name":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons","type":"Game","console":["Switch"],"dates_consumed":["recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","recfTDIOzhEyu3kBW","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","rec6uO13Kxfkdgon8","recRS9CJ1Vl1MBF4R","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","rechx7UstyEBIR9Bk"],"i_own_this?":true,"id":"rec23ELgutsNjRzQt"},{"name":"Ethics in the Real World","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-09","author":"Peter Singer","genre":["Philosophy"],"year":"2017","dates_consumed":["rec3vx6TL1nWxgEd4","rec5dzZ1ra8F5GTIQ","recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","rec20vtmhWLIyuRBo","recIV1BosYkzdWrgP","recWJYrKIGVZDw53M","rec9To33qKMjkay5q","recy4HMSp2VLB2r9f","reciEh6A2YMC6Vx2K","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","rec9oqqx4PSpU5lgt","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recFISAvuV4TrqiLb","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","rec7Moz7jevJSrKoP","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recDxLXUPBqbH36j6","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","rec3pkQzbxa26kNXr","recdGUvpf4Hlp4YI0","rec17Rf4bUOOaAmTL"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attZkwBFzGv2e9xpH","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/4ad3e4782ce8404195067af35b5e5295/5e33a4ad/9780691172477.jpgw640","filename":"9780691172477.jpg?w=640","size":173934,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/444d9e769edd5ab8ec8839ecaf4c75c6/097c3070","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0b90cfd8a1e754f5b6cf9ab8f079a1be/0af1e06e","width":512,"height":791},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/63f3bb031b2579d16d1cf19a1132e395/e166cab4","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Cursory essays, generally in a frustrating way but with some great gems.","id":"rec9aGiHSf7EJddDi"},{"name":"Radical Markets","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-04-07","dates_consumed":["recpV7G8lVxXhuBzI","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recHabmAqLIv5nMWS","recDQZQioqZp6JZ7t","recn6jtji806DLkcN","recrc2iwt7QVcSlcr","rechx7UstyEBIR9Bk","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz"],"image":[{"id":"attY9a2svQKrIkqtD","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/ceec0fd47b93e6ccce14a3e2ed33f791/6f01fd30/9780691177502.jpg","filename":"9780691177502.jpg","size":1244636,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/aed10098247018e6636d16657ffe6134/b07a97f7","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/948fe684fda98e9b27bb00c3cc3a48e8/a54c0545","width":512,"height":796},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ef3282eb6a159c0eb4f2d575ba98031b/e954bbca","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book went from enchanting to cursory _extremely_ quickly, but learning about self-assessed taxes and quadratic voting was worth the anodyne second half.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong.

His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive

StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"}],"id":"recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP"},{"date":"2020-02-25","content":[{"name":"Caffeine","type":"Book","rating":4,"date":"2020-02-27","author":"Michael Pollon","genre":["Nonfiction","Audiobook"],"dates_consumed":["reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recO0vrOJAmqKtAOW"],"image":[{"id":"att2DSrZ1eLa7WYfo","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6912c07c55bb18a20ffeeb8988dc0fd1/9bcdb12c/d2fdfb6b-0181-41dd-84a2-38aca8dbd4d1-Caffeine.jpgwidth650height650fitcropformatpjpgautowebp","filename":"d2fdfb6b-0181-41dd-84a2-38aca8dbd4d1-Caffeine.jpg?width=650\u0026height=650\u0026fit=crop\u0026format=pjpg\u0026auto=webp","size":42541,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7de86316caf8d50756620d0ce89c2b96/1e760973","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5fb550e7fa3a43ca4f86b633d50d4e88/b7af793e","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/826fb02ab59e898c3c52d633aedee00f/c154ffd8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book was a fun listen but I don't think any of it stands up to serious thought or scrutiny","id":"recNXVfKBFEaA4OF3"}],"id":"recO0vrOJAmqKtAOW"},{"date":"2020-02-24","id":"receJoAcmVCMtPAeD"},{"date":"2020-02-23","content":[{"name":"Slay the Spire","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2019-05-20","console":["macOS"],"dates_consumed":["recnHsdN3D34jrHaM","recCK6J4CKiaFVAGN","recHHZksWxBd0AlCC","reccY2xXfVUTakyhV","recUcp6vKPuB1VOep","recLHcNSdWcLX3tmY","recGdHYHoX4zhKV8o","reckTqdHY0o5Z16Dt","recCkFQNE1oI0mXS8","rec8UlEj6y7aDMsFK","recxcIoY6InASd4nb","rec7jbHPz5dCSG69t","rec9SnpwYirk659E7","recmx5yQAdiKepWcD","recdVb9FE39nT5AsD","recZV9qtFzG5NCowz","rec8CRLP9K8MvwPZ2","recEZKkbSCcBmCplL","recE9519Ke96AoW8E","recIUuilZycbNo56S","recFsEMVtdB3DWlNW","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","reczkg0PQmBRCZMQe","recg7RWL0r3yev0ZP","recvGXbX15AMhmcfL","rec1f1UgdbyBYLT9T","recaiHpSFgskvV9Eq","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","rec2cAwNDFTWieOrF","recZGO7aia7WxkusG","rec6MrXZFWX04pv6h","rec8V4Cte7u5VKKVO","rec5HJsRo3wEkjlo3","reclA0WkcKDVmSDxS","recSqGjCdDoHiI2Fd","recMoCH30lp8jBIRz","recd8IrGVxm4Uhpeg","recYKXJJjkAzQ8zra","rec6ys73dALHD9mAl","rec3ksnf6lmGkg6Ps","recS7OQfJyG0tBgEc","recLtAn25A5lGWRkL","recZrMS07VXdcn5c9","rec6ftizLeMMJG92z","recMEse9mfNcQfQf4","recnvgTK4EkvA7mKP","recE6KRrrRP1ogobo","recY1GOmhxPhcFJjF","recRiWLfgq8AqZQJ0","recDAMxX5UtrBw1QX","recEE0dNXRGGFb4xA","recxGUBNl6DxExcoa","rec2Du54qpqvhhVX5","recBm3fWmefdUlgYv","rec62lqChvtn6Sf8S","recxMvXQHTECBmH21","recaoX2zS6GzfudZW","recag1RvfvFkeHl7P","recHk4s1NUbq8zbhZ","recxXRJOwnXdD8Jcw","rec0rda9NaOxzokkL","recdkFHe6BvtolHJA","rec9jGydG0eQe0UIj","recTs6CEiLSxZHqrn","rec3dfi36KKDnDVjH","recOP8WvCKI2gVEvo","recPRyvthCQ2nhqEb","recwdhIQUbhLOtE2i","rec1Eki5XLUikokeq","recHbVmCcj0Bv8Stx","rectFkzvw7OVqrB39","recrwFP2LI5YPOBKl","recA6eZIpdusIzeOE","recQ0IbqA7NuTfjmw","recYj0gDDMXP8PGAa","recUgIrskPHEaANZy","rect22CZTKA9pMJtu","recfJAqj08z9LDVIc","recrJTfNaebG03cwZ","recAylqueGhIhbjdh","recOwZv6TdNVuE4n6","recztd1vsYFNBhBzZ","recmAAuTHUNU0T7KI","recaJ7eKJN6KJJVBO","rec44C8F1SgaUZjEO","recemGeaf43BLnwti","rec8j9PT8OEsWLyU0","recU36cyUjgxc8UCj","recN8qFrLjW3hDZm1","recYyflMdOfZuW3Eq","recefPuKJosxdPwKs","rechx41JxttomNXcf","recZ5XW7DWxxd9QJp","recVgJfnnVgT1RAVJ","recyy2fo9Q7tIsolD","recLLet6h1M4qIdqo","recb6xrXktaZ4bMJk","recn6QUR5oYLSZxcr","recVy19Yjtfcrltsx","rec2djA77qp2z1Xtk","recteN9O4jqx6AI2B","recIn9yQlGCkCfi7T","recM4Vc9HGBhwtWIu","recSWd4eIeQDwh55F","recl0qqbSggYbx548"],"image":[{"id":"attynU94PcMo53RlK","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60208eb50d7589a71c122a37d5559085/c5a0ea35/Slay-the-Spire","filename":"Slay-the-Spire","size":348193,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b04896af2f8566f66d878ccfec120f56/059d10be","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3686eeac0a90e4e6be60bbf1e980c809/c279a0ba","width":512,"height":824},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/532dce58e4b2ced699f7cf9de059cf1d/78f03e7b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"In lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Getting Things Done","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-03-02","genre":["Non-Fiction"],"dates_consumed":["recRfZP4yDfXf6A4O","recQY8IbFJFZLRwFj","rectNsuaQV9uox13g","rec2BeDAm8nYW0RPn","recD1TNszFtG1VnwR","recIuGH92fJrbqO0h","recsxyMcSRitWdOos","reczoPUDjEJlRChtg","recwu3NHYkCAUojrF","recytfLUZnGu4gWAk","recSFNxMOMhWhrKjD","rec8j9MUCejJ3Z3rP"],"image":[{"id":"attRHAfflYHPdLuSl","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c4d98040242128d33c7dc62f688e9a5/e20a145b/81trXFlSkCL.jpg","filename":"81trXFlSkCL.jpg","size":393573,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2144ac2fdf7058a372530a5d6768de1a/6fdc4dcd","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b00e8630d9165b092ac25cff67e2c06a/d91c9605","width":512,"height":801},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/53849e03a1f30ce35e818b56b3e1c9fe/7736697f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"GTD, the methodology: love it.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played.

His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"The Remains of the

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"The Remains of the

(I call this “early access syndrome” — releasing to passionate beta users both gives you the privilege of adding a bunch of new content because it’s easy and you don’t have the time pressure, plus it means you’re building content for experienced players rather than novices.)\n\nThe middle third of the game (everything surrounding Gaia’s Garden, basically) is rough and frustrating and caused me to quit the game once and put it down a second time.\n\nBut, man. The first fifteen hours of this game is the most pleasant I’ve had in a game maybe ever.  It hits all of my nostalgia points — the faux MMO nature reminds me of MapleStory, the characters and writing is warm and charming, and the core gameplay is just so goddamn fun.
