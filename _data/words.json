Advice from the authors are either bizarrely specific (only mount things two feet from the couch) or helplessly vague (bring nature in by adding rocks and wood to your living room).\n\nThere's nothing wrong with the book: if you have eight dollars and an hour to spare you'll probably enjoy it more than reading through Twitter.

I don’t think there’s anything, like, exclamatory about the film — I wouldn’t peg it for a five-Academy-Award winner — but it was good and fun and easy to recommend.","notebook":["recL8OZTAMNAYKKGo"],"dictionary":["reckHKtAqS2QiaoQk"],"id":"recmohXfj1YGZFwDQ"}],"id":"reckHKtAqS2QiaoQk"},{"name":"neonate","definition":"a newborn child","source":"NYT Crossword","date":"2020-10-17","id":"reccUnKL79YYp0QXi"},{"name":"quincunx","definition":"an arrangement of five objects with four at the corners of a square or rectangle and the fifth at its center","source":"NYT Crossword","date":"2020-10-17","id":"recBMXKEGjBNUHF55"},{"name":"neotony","definition":"the retention of juvenile features in the adult animal","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-10-17","id":"recMteJVw1hSRPUBz"},{"name":"neoteric","definition":"new or modern; recent","source":"Wikipedia","date":"2020-10-15","id":"recuEoxyF8jkKdrfe"},{"name":"ablation","definition":"a procedure for restoring normal heart rhythm","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-10-13","id":"recAR4biP3mfXtUj8"},{"name":"clement","definition":"mild and peaceful","date":"2020-10-13","content":[{"name":"Piranesi","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-10-13","author":"Susanna Clarke","genre":["Audiobook"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-10-07","2020-10-08","2020-10-09","2020-10-10","2020-10-11","2020-10-12","2020-10-13"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attvRR44mrzti3rux","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9e04f13299950e11b3ab486d99067b3a/1e9bb6e7/piranesi.jpg","filename":"piranesi.jpg","size":31572,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/567a7bd6ea6df054f643d8334f00f868/974ccd1b","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/39dfb678800287c7a5f23df8e4f7b34b/a23f4393","width":331,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5aef0db5c469feb91d8d61072e0efcbd/110d26f7","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"There's a lot to like about this book.

I found myself weirdly disappointed with only two things: the \"twist\", if you could call it that, is pretty immediately obvious (gee, I wonder what a \"shining rectangle\" could be!) and the denouement/climax felt extremely pre-ordained: not a single scrap of the final 20% of the book was surprising or interesting, even if I thoroughly enjoyed how you get there.","notebook":["recjqwJ7odjOStNut"],"source":"@Theophite","dictionary":["recKs0vfV3lzy54Cj"],"id":"recx80BQvbYVUGv4J"}],"id":"recKs0vfV3lzy54Cj"},{"name":"oracular","definition":"hard to interpret; enigmatic","source":"Patrick Collison","date":"2020-10-12","id":"recybyF8zNrFDiFkb"},{"name":"carom","definition":"strike and rebound","source":"Reddit","date":"2020-10-11","id":"recdhZ3bMAOjIOVCd"},{"name":"dysgenic","definition":"exerting a detrimental effect on later generations through the inheritance of undesirable characteristics","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-10-05","id":"recbX004SmO7NxyDw"},{"name":"oleaginous","definition":"rich with, covered in, or heavily producing oil or grease","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-10-04","id":"rec3kyD70ZN9K9h8e"},{"name":"extirpate","definition":"root out and destroy completely","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-10-01","id":"recHAeKWqJLZiXujj"},{"name":"suet","definition":"the hard white fat on the kidneys and loins of cattle, sheep, and other animals, used to make foods including puddings, pastry, and mincemeat","source":"NYT Crossword","date":"2020-10-01","id":"rece0KAnfp31yhdvj"},{"name":"offal","definition":"the entrails and internal organs of an animal used as food.","source":"NYT Crossword","date":"2020-09-30","id":"rec4SKyKwBYoSFi6C"},{"name":"syncytium","definition":"a single cell or cytoplasmic mass containing several nuclei, formed by fusion of cells or by division of nuclei","source":"Wikipedia","date":"2020-09-30","id":"recpp06cKVQHOJbL8"},{"name":"funicular","definition":"a cable railroad, especially one on a mountainside, in which ascending and descending cars are counterbalanced.","date":"2020-09-29","content":[{"name":"The Lying Life of Adults","type":"Book","rating":6,"date":"2020-10-09","author":"Elena Ferrante","year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-09-19","2020-09-29","2020-09-30","2020-10-02","2020-10-03","2020-10-04","2020-10-09"],"image":[{"id":"attrTPSyn7mcRHSkn","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/9cd826ef19fafb64ded20d3fb84ecbb3/93f15073/lying.png","filename":"lying.png","size":73300,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/dbfd362a9f2d3966b84a2e93949314e0/2880d278","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5efc2a8e1361de56b99d4adf4ba310e0/0f86ba80","width":220,"height":342},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/67eb021f52e7177b697ab01b6f68528c/736faf64","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"My general understanding of Ferrante's non-quadrilogical work is that it pales in comparison, and so my expectations for this book were relatively low. Not colossally low — I loved the Neapolitan Novels! — but relatively low.\n\nAnd I think the book more or less bore that out. There were aspects in which it outshone those novels: I think the portrayal of youth, of budding sexuality and the sense of anagnorisis that all children go through as they learn of their parents is much more vivid and true-ringing than the childhood depicted in her more famous work.\n\nBut the book felt minor and shallow in so many respects compared to its famous siblings. Gone is the rich, beautiful, and terrifying depictions of Naples; gone is the sense of time and evolution that a reader witnesses. What's left is almost a Murakami-esque procession of plot points and themes — sure, Ferrante talks about the difference between order and justice, sure, Ferrante talks about the blinding madness of love, sure, Ferrante talks about the pain of beauty and the pain of gender — but you have heard these things before, and you do not mind hearing them again but you are not blown away by them.","notebook":["recefNtdglzVU43zN"],"dictionary":["recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"],"id":"recwQCkOE2wdVVbMG"}],"id":"recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"},{"name":"salvific","definition":"leading to salvation","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-09-24","id":"recefPTAlaUmNYCDr"},{"name":"missal","definition":"a book containing the texts used in the Catholic Mass throughout the year","source":"NYT Crossword","date":"2020-09-23","id":"recDhkUH7Kl6mIM31"},{"name":"aporia","definition":"an irresolvable internal contradiction or logical disjunction in a text, argument, or theory","source":"Twitter","date":"2020-09-22","id":"rectQoemiLXW04BMm"},{"name":"slatternly","definition":"(relating to a woman’s appearance) dirty and untidy","source":"Wikipedia","date":"2020-09-21","id":"recBsahnsVGAxghrF"},{"name":"chthonic","definition":"concerning, belonging to, or inhabiting the underworld.","date":"2020-09-20","content":[{"name":"Hades","type":"Game","rating":9,"date":"2020-10-24","year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-09-20","2020-09-21","2020-09-22","2020-09-23","2020-09-24","2020-09-25","2020-09-26","2020-09-27","2020-09-29","2020-10-01","2020-10-02","2020-10-03","2020-10-04","2020-10-09","2020-10-10","2020-10-11","2020-10-13","2020-10-16","2020-10-17","2020-10-18","2020-10-23"],"image":[{"id":"attyqt3qWoXT9UcxR","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/dd82d2b809e688a68f4807ae52c0473d/bc85e89b/hades.jpg","filename":"hades.jpg","size":145895,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2f5a643c2d7edef114871ab0f78c10cf/4171d839","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/995f2d606296533bd9f54c9672af906e/a9499887","width":250,"height":345},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c7bdc28c8cf778f1bd375469ca4f9184/75f22222","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I don’t think I have anything interesting to say about Hades that hasn’t been already said by many of its (justifiably) adoring fans. It’s a legitimate contender for GOTY, and deservedly so. The game is interesting, fun, and succeeds at everything that it sets out to do. If I were to try and sum up its victories in a few points, here’s what I’d start with:\n\n- Weapon and build variation mean that characters feel much different within minutes of each run.\n- The core gameplay loop sits at around thirty minutes, which is perfect.\n- Story progression (which fits perfectly within the framing device of the game) is tied to death, so you look forward to losses as opposed to the common roguelike feeling of “well, jeez, that was a waste.”\n- Metaprogression (both in terms of your character getting stronger between runs and the difficulty scaling up in the postgame) is incredibly smooth and elegant.\n\nThe plot, setting, voicing, and art direction are all just really good and, again, tie in extremely well with the story. I’m at a loss to say what can be improved about it: the runs started feeling a little repetitive towards the end, and some of the currency/story unlocking is stingy, but it’s just an incredibly good game and one that I look forward to playing more of down the line.\n\n...So why isn't it a 10? Because it didn't consume my life, I guess. The two most recent 10/10 games I played were CrossCode and Slay The Spire, both of which I daydreamed about and spent shower time thinking about and never wanted to end.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more.

It is legitimately very very funny, the history is all accurate, and the metastory of the author's battle with hermitage, depression, and eventual suicide casts an interesting pallor over the entire affair. Cuppy manages to thread an increasing thesis through all of the loosely interconnected tales: powerful figures are flawed in very entertaining, boring, predictable ways, and that historiography fails us in our understanding of them.\n\nBut I just... felt like it dragged.
