Insofar as our earlier theoretical discussion of structural violence\nrevealed anything, it was this: that while those in situations of power and privilege often\nfeel it as a terrible burden of responsibility, in most ways, most of the time, power is all\nabout what you don’t have to worry about, don’t have to know about, and don’t have to do.\nBureaucracies can democratize this sort of power, at least to an extent, but they can’t get rid\nof it. It becomes forms of institutionalized laziness. Revolutionary change may involve the\nexhilaration of throwing off imaginative shackles, of suddenly realizing that impossible\nthings are not impossible at all, but it also means most people will have to get over some of\nthis deeply habituated laziness and start engaging in interpretive (imaginative) labor for a\nvery long time to make those realities stick.","id":"recZ6uuiiSoCbfA3s"},{"name":2,"text":"Just as the worst slave-owners were those who were kind to their slaves, and so prevented the horror of the system being realised by those who suffered from it, and understood by those who contemplated it, so, in the present state of things in England, the people who do most harm are the people who try to do most good.","author":"Oscar Wilde","source_url":"https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/wilde-oscar/soul-man/","id":"rec07azoRGtPWfAAQ"},{"name":3,"source":{"name":"Ficciones","type":"Book","rating":9,"date":"2020-06-02","author":"Jorge Luis Borges","genre":["Audiobook","Short Stories","Fiction"],"year":"1944","dates_consumed":["2020-05-30","2020-05-31","2020-06-01","2020-06-02"],"summary":"Terrific stories that leave you wanting more (and now I understand where a lot of Calvino and Chiaing comes from.)

Often relationships that were central during war, dissolve during peace. Some people who were brave and fearless in war are unable to handle peace, feel disconnected and confused. Other times people in war make the move to peace very easily. Always people die in wars. And always people are left shattered by the loss of loved ones.\n\nThat’s what happens, so that’s what I wrote. Jake and Cassie were in love during the war, and end up going their seperate ways afterward. Jake, who was so brave and capable during the war is adrift during the peace. Marco and Ax, on the other hand, move easily past the war and even manage to use their experience to good effect. Rachel dies, and Tobias will never get over it. That doesn’t by any means cover everything that happens in a war, but it’s a start.\n\nHere’s what doesn’t happen in war: there are no wondrous, climactic battles that leave the good guys standing tall and the bad guys lying in the dirt. Life isn’t a World Wrestling Federation Smackdown. Even the people who win a war, who survive and come out the other side with the conviction that they have done something brave and necessary, don’t do a lot of celebrating. There’s very little chanting of ‘we’re number one’ among people who’ve personally experienced war.\n\nI’m just a writer, and my main goal was always to entertain. But I’ve never let Animorphs turn into just another painless video game version of war, and I wasn’t going to do it at the end. I’ve spent 60 books telling a strange, fanciful war story, sometimes very seriously, sometimes more tongue-in-cheek. I’ve written a lot of action and a lot of humor and a lot of sheer nonsense. But I have also, again and again, challenged readers to think about what they were reading. To think about the right and wrong, not just the who-beat-who. And to tell you the truth I’m a little shocked that so many readers seemed to believe I’d wrap it all up with a lot of high-fiving and backslapping. Wars very often end, sad to say, just as ours did: with a nearly seamless transition to another war.\n\nSo, you don’t like the way our little fictional war came out? You don’t like Rachel dead and Tobias shattered and Jake guilt-ridden? You don’t like that one war simply led to another? Fine. Pretty soon you’ll all be of voting age, and of draft age. So when someone proposes a war, remember that even the most necessary wars, even the rare wars where the lines of good and evil are clear and clean, end with a lot of people dead, a lot of people crippled, and a lot of orphans, widows and grieving parents.","author":"K.A.

A short space, especially when the darkness dims so soon, and so soon a bird sings, a cock crows, or a faint green quickens, like a turning leaf, in the hollow of the wave. Night, however, succeeds to night. The winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally, evenly, with indefatigable fingers. They lengthen; they darken. Some of them hold aloft clear planets, plates of brightness. The autumn trees, ravaged as they are, take on the flash of tattered flags kindling in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in Indian sands. The autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight, in the light of harvest moons, the light which mellows the energy of labour, and smooths the stubble, and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore. It seemed now as if, touched by human penitence and all its toil, divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it, single, distinct, the hare erect; the wave falling; the boat rocking; which, did we deserve them, should be ours always. But alas, divine goodness, twitching the cord, draws the curtain; it does not please him; he covers his treasures in a drench of hail, and so breaks them, so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth. For our penitence deserves a glimpse only; our toil respite only. The nights now are full of wind and destruction; the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths. Also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself, and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts, a sharer of his solitude, throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand, no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul. The hand dwindles in his hand; the voice bellows in his ear. Almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what, and why, and wherefore, which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer.\n\n[Mr. Ramsay, stumbling along a passage one dark morning, stretched his arms out, but Mrs. Ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before, his arms, though stretched out, remained empty.]\n\n\n","id":"rec4sFWPt207QOIx0"},{"name":7,"text":"Internal communication based on long-form writing, rather than a verbal tradition of meetings, speaking, and chatting, leads to a welcomed reduction in meetings, video conferences, calls, or other real-time opportunities to interrupt and be interrupted.\n\n","author":"David Heinemeier Hansson","source_url":"https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate","id":"recV3UMm02fE0jC40"},{"name":8,"text":"Poor communication creates more work.\n\n","author":"David Heinemeier Hansson","source_url":"https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate","id":"recGNBEuIk2wUCkab"},{"name":9,"text":"Communication often interrupts, so good communication is often about saying the right thing at the right time in the right way with the fewest side effects.\n\n","author":"David Heinemeier Hansson","source_url":"https://basecamp.com/guides/how-we-communicate","id":"reclIjNdExdN4WBYP"},{"name":10,"source":{"name":"Slouching Towards Bethlehem","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-03-24","author":"Joan Didion","dates_consumed":["2020-03-22","2020-03-21","2020-03-20","2020-03-18","2020-03-17","2020-03-16","2020-03-04","2020-03-03","2020-03-02"],"image":[{"id":"att2QeFnmXuvPfJg4","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/60f03a19b95ac9cd869fbdeab2f0f4ea/0bfec4d3/9780374531386_p0_v4_s550x406.jpg","filename":"9780374531386_p0_v4_s550x406.jpg","size":20924,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/98be95a88e18c277730bfc9a80683893/0cf99770","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fd18438cae8c5c23423ff0dd73a0db8d/ccb99b9b","width":270,"height":406},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a3a2cb04f91e0fb4b67be715905d3193/fafab63f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I think I am spoiled by late-period Didion, who has all of the precision and wit and remove of this book but can augment with it the wisdom and perspective that this book, with all of its moments of beauty, lacks","notebook":["rec04UfyP8e5i4B3A","recDmoDt6AqFVk8Wy","recsOae5ZigpNvgXd"],"id":"recc4VPSLBj8Ekuxy"},"text":"It all comes back.

The Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., is surely one of the most successful war memorials ever built, if one is to judge by the quantity and intensity of the visits it receives. Designed by Maya Lin, the memorial consists simply of a gently undulating site marked (not dominated) by a long, low, black marble wall listing the names of the fallen. The names are listed neither alphabetically nor by military unit but chronologically, in the order in which they fell—thus grouping those who had fallen on the same day in the same engagement.[895] No larger claim is made about the war either in prose or in sculpture—which is hardly surprising, in view of the stark political cleavages the war still inspires.[896] What is most remarkable, however, is the way that the Vietnam Memorial works for those who visit it, particularly those who come to pay their respects to the memory of a comrade or loved one. They touch the names incised on the wall, make rubbings, and leave artifacts and mementos of their own—everything from poems and a woman’s highheeled shoe to a glass of champagne and a poker hand of a full house, aces high. So many of these tributes have been left, in fact, that a museum has been created to house them. The scene of many people together at the wall, touching the names of particular loved ones who fell in the same war, has moved observers regardless of their position on the war itself. I believe that a great part of the memorial’s symbolic power is its capacity to honor the dead with an openness that allows visitors to impress upon it their own meanings, their own histories, their own memories. The memorial virtually requires participation in order to complete its meaning. Although one would not compare it to a Rorschach test, the memorial nevertheless does achieve its meaning as much by what citizens bring to it as by what it imposes.\n\nCompare the Vietnam Memorial to a very different American war memorial: the sculpture depicting the raising of the American flag at the summit of Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima in World War II. Moving in its own right, referring as it does to the final moment of a victory gained at an enormous cost in lives, the Iwo Jima statue is manifestly heroic. Its patriotism (symbolized by the flag), its reference to conquest, its larger-than-life scale, and its implicit theme of unity in victory leave little room for wondering what is expected from the viewer. Given the virtual unanimity with which that war was, and is, viewed in the United States, it is hardly surprising that the Iwo Jima memorial should be monumental and explicit about its message. Although not exactly “canned,” the Iwo Jima site is more symbolically self-sufficient, as are most war memorials. Visitors can stand in awe, gazing on an image that through photographs and sculpture has become a virtual icon for the War in the Pacific, but they receive its message rather than completing it.[897]\n\n","id":"recZlSAaXRX8fe4VW"},{"name":56,"source":{"name":"Seeing like a State","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2019-04-21","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"dates_consumed":["2019-04-21","2019-04-20","2019-04-19","2019-03-29","2019-03-27","2019-03-26","2019-03-25","2019-03-24","2019-03-19","2019-02-25","2019-02-24","2019-02-23","2019-02-22","2019-02-21","2019-02-20","2019-02-18","2019-02-17","2019-02-16","2019-02-15","2019-02-14","2019-02-13"],"image":[{"id":"attaidzCWy4tvZjoD","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7a9e69c2b0b82d8539f4c04a6e2d8aab/d65b09c9/41wNdayiE2L.jpg","filename":"41wNdayiE2L.jpg","size":30786,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4731df889e191058d89713cb560e4cc4/1f92cec0","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/024d1d57b8006ed3e9f54129456bf560/33186075","width":305,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/976035f68705380889c5168b7b7a3166/4fcca0ab","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"notebook":["recckc1gW4gmky6wN","recZlSAaXRX8fe4VW","recKjqxXq8U5KzLjo"],"id":"recXcPojySASnULJS"},"text":"One might, on the basis of experience, derive a few rules of thumb that, if observed, could make development planning less prone to disaster. While my main goal is hardly a point-by-point reform of development practice, such rules would surely include something along the following lines.\n\nTake small steps. In an experimental approach to social change, presume that we cannot know the consequences of our interventions in advance. Given this postulate of ignorance, prefer wherever possible to take a small step, stand back, observe, and then plan the next small move. As the biologist J. B. S. Haldane metaphorically described the advantages of smallness: “You can drop a mouse down a thousand-yard mineshaft; and on arriving at the bottom, it gets a slight shock and walks away. A rat is killed, a man broken, a horse splashes.”\n\nFavor reversibility. Prefer interventions that can easily be undone if they turn out to be mistakes. Irreversible interventions have irreversible consequences.Interventions into ecosystems require particular care in this respect, given our great ignorance about how they interact. Aldo Leopold captured the spirit of caution required: “The first rule of intelligent tinkering is to keep all the parts.”\n\nPlan on surprises. Choose plans that allow the largest accommodation to the unforeseen. In agricultural schemes this may mean choosing and preparing land so that it can grow any of several crops. In planning housing, it would mean “designing in” flexibility for accommodating changes in family structures or living styles. In a factory it may mean selecting a location, layout, or piece of machinery that allows for new processes, materials, or product lines down the road.\n\nPlan on human inventiveness. Always plan under the assumption that those who become involved in the project later will have or will develop the experience and insight to improve on the design.\n\n","id":"recKjqxXq8U5KzLjo"},{"name":57,"source":{"name":"The Story of The Lost

Presently, the levels of sound and music in the environment have clearly exceeded man’s capacity to assimilate them, and the audio ecosystem is beginning to fall apart. Background music, which is supposed to create ‘atmosphere’, is far too excessive. In our present condition, we find that within certain areas and spaces, aspects of visual design are well attended to, but sound design is completely ignored. It is necessary to treat sound and music with the same level of daily need as we treat architecture, interior design, food, or the air we breathe. In any case, the “Wave Notation” series has begun. I hope it will be used and judged for what I had in mind as ‘sound design’, but of course the listener is free to use it in any way.

He was so nervous, in fact, that when Mister Rogers did visit, he got mad at himself and began hating himself and hitting himself, and his mother had to take him to another room and talk to him. Mister Rogers didn’t leave, though. He wanted something from the boy, and Mister Rogers never leaves when he wants something from somebody. He just waited patiently, and when the boy came back, Mister Rogers talked to him, and then he made his request. He said, “I would like you to do something for me. Would you do something for me?” On his computer, the boy answered yes, of course, he would do anything for Mister Rogers, so then Mister Rogers said, “I would like you to pray for me. Will you pray for me?” And now the boy didn’t know how to respond. He was thunderstruck. Thunderstruck means that you can’t talk, because something has happened that’s as sudden and as miraculous and maybe as scary as a bolt of lightning, and all you can do is listen to the rumble. The boy was thunderstruck because nobody had ever asked him for something like that, ever. The boy had always been prayed for. The boy had always been the object of prayer, and now he was being asked to pray for Mister Rogers, and although at first he didn’t know if he could do it, he said he would, he said he’d try, and ever since then he keeps Mister Rogers in his prayers and doesn’t talk about wanting to die anymore, because he figures Mister Rogers is close to God, and if Mister Rogers likes him, that must mean God likes him, too.\n\nAs for Mister Rogers himself…well, he doesn’t look at the story in the same way that the boy did or that I did. In fact, when Mister Rogers first told me the story, I complimented him on being so smart—for knowing that asking the boy for his prayers would make the boy feel better about himself—and Mister Rogers responded by looking at me at first with puzzlement and then with surprise. “Oh, heavens no, Tom! I didn’t ask him for his prayers for him; I asked for me. I asked him because I think that anyone who has gone through challenges like that must be very close to God. I asked him because I wanted his intercession.”\n\n","author":"Tom Junod","source_url":"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a27134/can-you-say-hero-esq1198/","id":"reczUPuW92EYwjByH"},{"name":154,"text":"an apartment filled with music, hiss of damp clothes\ndrying on the radiator, a prayer made with a record’s broken needle\nto become beaming and undone.\n","author":"Kendra Decolo","source_url":"Playlist: 11 Weeks","id":"recbY10A2Ojb0SOTi"},{"name":155,"text":"say: that boy he look like a hollowed-out grandfather clock. he look like a million-dollar god with a two-cent heaven. like all it takes is one kiss \u0026 before morning, you could scatter his whole mind across a field.\n\n","author":"Hanif Abdurraqib","id":"recLpkkTTz9PGybOg"},{"name":156,"text":"I myself am probably too washed to pinpoint the moment that “washed”—an existential description that has become ubiquitous in the past few years, as the American empire ebbs and exhaustion sets in—first entered the culture.

He also has a knack for getting the ball to teammates who are in a position to do the same, and he commits few turnovers. On defense, although he routinely guards the N.B.A.’s most prolific scorers, he significantly ­reduces their shooting percentages. At the same time he somehow improves the defensive efficiency of his teammates — probably, Morey surmises, by helping them out in all sorts of subtle ways. “I call him Lego,” Morey says. “When he’s on the court, all the pieces start to fit together.

Only people who have been “down the line,” as the song puts it, know what this music is about. White Americans do not understand the depths out of which such an ironic tenacity comes, but they suspect that the force is sensual, and they are terrified of sensuality, and do not any longer understand it. The word “sensual” is not intended to bring to mind quivering dusky maidens or priapic black studs. I am referring to something much simpler and much less fanciful.

When the geese had all departed, they saw the reason they had left; a herd of giant deer had come to the lake to drink. The stags had huge racks of antlers. They stared across the water at the men, vigilant but undeterred. For a moment, all was still. In the end the giant deer stepped away. Reality awoke again. “All sentient beings,” said I-Chin, who had been muttering his Buddhist sutras all along. Kheim normally had no time for such claptrap, but now, as the day continued, and they hiked over the hills on their hunt, seeing great numbers of peaceful beaver, quail, rabbits, foxes, seagulls and crows, ordinary deer, a bear and two cubs, a slinky long-tailed gray hunting creature, like a fox crossed with a squirrel—on and on—simply a whole country of animals, living together under a silent blue sky—nothing disturbed, the land flourishing on its own, the people there just a small part of it—Kheim began to feel odd. He realized that he had taken China for reality itself. Taiwan and the Mindanaos and the other islands he had seen were like scraps of land, leftovers; China had seemed to him the world. And China meant people. Built up, cultivated, parceled off ha by ha, it was so completely a human world that Kheim had never considered that there might once have been a natural world different to it. But here was natural land, right before his eyes, full as could be with animals of every kind, and obviously very much bigger than Taiwan; bigger than China; bigger than the world he had known before. “Where on Earth are we?” he said to I-Chin.

Had been affable, joking servants, of whom our masters had grown fond for the cheering words we managed as they launched forth on days full of import. Had been grandmothers, tolerant and frank, recipients of certain dark secrets,who, by the quality of their unjudging listening, granted tacit forgiveness, and thus let in the sun.

And there are millions more who feel predestination in ‘Thou shalt.’ Nothing they may do can interfere with what will be. But ‘Thou mayest’!

He can choose his course and fight it through and win.” Lee’s voice was a chant of triumph.\n\nAdam said, “Do you believe that, Lee?”\n\n“Yes, I do. Yes, I do. It is easy out of laziness, out of weakness, to throw oneself into the lap of deity, saying, ‘I couldn’t help it; the way was set.’ But think of the glory of the choice! That makes a man a man. A cat has no choice, a bee must make honey. There’s no godliness there. And do you know, those old gentlemen who were sliding gently down to death are too interested to die now?”\n\nAdam said, “Do you mean these Chinese men believe the Old Testament?”\n\nLee said, “These old men believe a true story, and they know a true story when they hear it.

If we could run at 280,000,000 meters per second, there’d be no need for a special theory of relativity: it’d be obvious to everyone that the faster we go, the heavier and squatter we get, and the faster time elapses in the rest of the world. If we could live for 70,000,000 years, there’d be no theory of evolution, and certainly no creationism: we could watch speciation and adaptation with our eyes, instead of painstakingly reconstructing events from fossils and DNA. If we could bake bread at 20,000,000 degrees Kelvin, nuclear fusion would be not the esoteric domain of physicists but ordinary household knowledge. But we can’t do any of these things, and so we have science, to deduce about the gargantuan what we, with our infinitesimal faculties, will never sense.

Cuppy manages to thread an increasing thesis through all of the loosely interconnected tales: powerful figures are flawed in very entertaining, boring, predictable ways, and that historiography fails us in our understanding of them.\n\nBut I just... felt like it dragged.

The book demands nothing of your mind and little of your heart.\n\nThe charitable way: it's kind of fun! The audiobook narration is _excellent_, the rabbit-holing into internet fame rings true, and the story feels silly in the same way an endearing anime does — yeah, it's a silly trip, but you generally like the people involved so you go with it.\n\nI generally try to go with the Roger Ebert mechanism of criticism, which is asking \"how well does the work accomplish its goals?\" The book tries to do two things:\n\n1. It tries to be a fun, light-hearted science fiction romp, and I think it does that well.\n2. It tries to engage seriously with the concepts of internet fame, polarization, and (imagine my finger quotes here) The Discourse, and it fails utterly. Lampshading the protagonist's descent into vitriol is not a meaningful contribution; ignoring the role of technology and industry feels willfully ignorant.\n\nBut this is the first of a series, and the real question is: do I want to read the next book? And the answer is yes: it was light (this one took me around half a week) and relatively fun and I could turn my brain off.

Not colossally low — I loved the Neapolitan Novels! — but relatively low.\n\nAnd I think the book more or less bore that out. There were aspects in which it outshone those novels: I think the portrayal of youth, of budding sexuality and the sense of anagnorisis that all children go through as they learn of their parents is much more vivid and true-ringing than the childhood depicted in her more famous work.\n\nBut the book felt minor and shallow in so many respects compared to its famous siblings. Gone is the rich, beautiful, and terrifying depictions of Naples; gone is the sense of time and evolution that a reader witnesses. What's left is almost a Murakami-esque procession of plot points and themes — sure, Ferrante talks about the difference between order and justice, sure, Ferrante talks about the blinding madness of love, sure, Ferrante talks about the pain of beauty and the pain of gender — but you have heard these things before, and you do not mind hearing them again but you are not blown away by them.","notebook":["recefNtdglzVU43zN"],"dictionary":["recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"],"id":"recwQCkOE2wdVVbMG"},"text":"\"Isn't your superior God?\"\n\"Yes, but it's his lieutenants who call the shots.\"","date":"2020-10-02","id":"recefNtdglzVU43zN"},{"name":402,"text":"Instagram is a place where people can share beautiful photos of their lives, and when you engage in self-promotional behavior of any kind on Instagram it makes users who have shared that moment with you feel sad inside.","author":"Instagram Terms of Service","date":"2020-10-03","id":"reck8rPPTZZVKlSzg"},{"name":403,"text":"Art is how we decorate space; music is how we decorate time.","author":"Jean-Michel Basquiat","date":"2020-10-04","id":"rec4MDT0G24af0Xh9"},{"name":404,"source":{"name":"No Filter","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-10-07","author":"Sarah Frier","genre":["Audiobook"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-09-29","2020-09-30","2020-10-01","2020-10-02","2020-10-03","2020-10-04","2020-10-05","2020-10-06","2020-10-07"],"image":[{"id":"attZP0MKtOrd4bCa9","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/157ac7843252b3438da60fc9e32bd23f/7fc28370/nofilter.jpg","filename":"nofilter.jpg","size":19432,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1dd922f47c121e03e9ab4988ef2a249d/a46fa0cf","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7a9248ec9dd769c052d8853e23ddedbe/9af79977","width":331,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7e949d9b5883a120e63956b5ce024189/0604d687","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A pleasant and uncontroversial read; it is not the exciting tell-all that Bad Blood or to a lesser extent Super Pumped was, but I think its lack of emphasis on _drama_ gave it a more sober lens with which to view Instagram's transformation. Some scattered thoughts:\n\n- It is slightly disappointing how vacuous the reporting on Early Instagram is, compared to the post-Facebook acquisition. Three hours in and the company’s been bought; the majority of the section didn’t even talk about scaling the company but about Systrom getting various backers and celebrities!\n- It is entertaining though how wholesome the rise to power is compared to Bad Blood or Super Pumped. The thesis of this book is clearly about Systrom being a pretty good guy who tried to protect his work from Facebook.\n- A very interesting aside during the antitrust drama: Facebook’s entire case for it not being a monopolistic move is that they could point to Facebook Camera being a much weaker and less popular app than Instagram, and thus they were doing something rationally competitive (rather than framing it against Facebook’s app itself.) This is ingenious and evil and makes me wonder if all of Facebook’s shovelware apps have the same purpose: to make M\u0026A (and various competitive analyses) more palatable.\n- One useful point this book is emphasizing is just how feature-poor Instagram was for so long. Editing captions; DMs; video posts; none of these things existed pre-acquisition, which is somehow hilarious and trenchant.\n- More Twitter than Instagram, but I was surprised to learn that the Ellen selfie was completely staged.

When possible, the police aggressively and proactively prevent the formation of movements and public expressions of rage, but when necessary they will fall back on brute force. Therefore, while the specific forms that policing takes have changed as the nature of inequality and the forms of resistance to it have shifted over time, the basic function of managing the poor, foreign and nonwhite on behalf of a system of economic and political inequality remains.","date":"2020-10-18","id":"recrllayj7wJyv0CE"},{"name":415,"text":"You all keep coming to a gun fight with infographics.","author":"Ayesha A.

This portion should have been wholly excised and the book would have been much stronger for it.\n\nThe most interesting parts of the book come when the author has sudden and fleeting moments of clarity (\"am I an absolute hypocrite for indulging in this culture despite being a vegetarian, given that the dairy industry exploits animals?\" and \"faced with objective proof that my palate is underdeveloped, have I not actually learned anything at all about cheese besides proper nouns?\"). The truth is that I liked this book because it was a microcosm of all consumerist movements. You could replace the references to cheese with craft beer or sourdough or cocktails and I'm sure there are identical books for all three; this is a book about how fun it is to dive into a weird subculture for a little, even as it passes you by.

When we speak, for instance, we don’t focus on the sounds we’re making, we focus on our words. We understand how to speak, but would struggle to explain it. Tacit knowledge comprises the vast majority of what we know; we rely on it constantly.\n\nWhen that knowledge begins to lead us astray, however, Polanyi tells us we that must delve into it. We must make it explicit. An explicit understanding of speech might be necessary for someone with a speech impediment, but also for a professional performer; to be at the top of your field, explicit knowledge is almost always required.\n\nA rare exception to this rule is the chicken sexer, who can quickly and accurately determine whether a day-old chick is male or female. The two are indistinguishable to most, but an expert can classify a thousand chicks an hour with 98% accuracy. The knowledge underpinning this expertise has never been made explicit; a trainee is simply corrected by an expert, over and over, until their intuition is equally refined.\n\nHeld to this standard, however, we all fall short. No one’s sensibilities about software design are so refined that they can teach simply through demonstration. We have to distill our intuition down to principles, and let those principles guide us beyond the bounds of our intuition. Anything less is just rentier pedagogy; maxims stripped of any context, whose true meaning within a given situation can only be judged by a single person.","author":"Zach Tellman","source_url":"https://ideolalia.com/essays/thought-leaders-and-chicken-sexers.html","date":"2020-12-06","id":"recGPQwsNXUPiygLJ"},{"name":439,"text":"Do good work.

It has its excitements and compensations. One of them is that, since you have none yourself, you are relieved of any responsibility for a future. And everything tastes better.\n\nIt is absolutely true, for example, that when you think, when you know, you are going to die somewhere soon, every day has a special, bright, delicious poignant taste to it that normal days in normal times do not have.

It is firefighters, garbage collectors, and busdrivers. It is bad coffee, the funniest guy in the breakroom, and the six days a week for one day off with your family.

It is a bbq with family and the first snap of a sausage when you bite into it. If the Chicago accent is ugly, then it is an acknowledgment that work in America is ugly, for nobody works like Chicago.","author":"Gus Menary","source_url":"https://twitter.com/localsadghoul/status/1337033608301850624/photo/1","date":"2020-12-09","id":"recjqKomlN6HL4qy9"},{"name":444,"text":"Happiness means being just rushed enough.","author":"John P.
