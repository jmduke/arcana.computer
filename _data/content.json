The world is the most charming game-world ever committed to Final Fantasy. The theatrical motifs are delightful; the minigames and sidequests are fun without being overbearing; the progression system is smart without being fiddly.

A friend of mine who's in finance told me that the book is a cult favorite in his office, as most of them did crew in college.\n2. There's gotta be a word for the narrative *neatness* that this book employs.  Of course the UW folks are the young upstarts — of course they are portrayed as the ones without money; the West Coasters; the hotheads and troubled but promising youths.  Massive success, then failure, then more uproarious success.  (I'm reminded of the article that I can't find about hearing a story about two geologists who take over a vineyard that centuries of Bordeaux veterans cannot salvage, and how most people expect them to fail [because that satisfies the narrative constraint of 'old knowledge'] and instead they succeed.)\n3. If nothing else, the book succeeds at teaching me about rowing, which I now love and find very interesting!  I am going to shoehorn \"mind in boat\" into a lot of things from now on.\n4. I love the glimpses into Old Seattle; particularly the idea of Capitol Hill, my current neighborhood, as being this remote and stately locale flush with moneyed Victorian manses.\n5. I admire the book not being too histrionic with the Americans' first experiences with Germany.  I would honestly love to learn more about the relationship between the AOC and the Third Reich in general; the book doesn't bring a lot of context or focus to the confluence of country, sport, and politic, which I get but I feel like that'd be more useful and interesting than the constant glimpses of Goebbels in the shadows.\n6. Grandness and spirit of adventure: this wasn't just these folks first times in Europe, but their first time away from home at all (plus on a cruise liner, etc.)\n7. Also a hilarious demarcation of how far nutrition and sports science has come in a hundred years: the progression of \"hmmm just eat steak and bananas\" to hyper regulated diets is fun.","id":"recggv1WowaLVdCvw"},{"name":"Bullshit

the game has flaws. \n\nIt’s overtuned and overstuffed; dungeons should be half the length, a third of the quests should be removed, and the challenge is clearly calibrated for folks who have spent three years on the engine. (I call this “early access syndrome” — releasing to passionate beta users both gives you the privilege of adding a bunch of new content because it’s easy and you don’t have the time pressure, plus it means you’re building content for experienced players rather than novices.)\n\nThe middle third of the game (everything surrounding Gaia’s Garden, basically) is rough and frustrating and caused me to quit the game once and put it down a second time.\n\nBut, man. The first fifteen hours of this game is the most pleasant I’ve had in a game maybe ever.  It hits all of my nostalgia points — the faux MMO nature reminds me of MapleStory, the characters and writing is warm and charming, and the core gameplay is just so goddamn fun.  I love the platforming; I love the trading and progression; I love the grinding on hedgehags.\n\nThis isn’t a perfect game but I can’t remember one that has highs quite as high as CrossCode.","id":"recxr5bHddW6fLq7O"},{"name":"So You Want To Talk About

think about the good times.\n\n_Sputnik Sweetheart_ was completely unremarkable within his ouevre. It was a good book, and if it was my first Murakami I would probably hold it in higher esteem — it certainly feels like it could be a good entry into his world — but it wasn't, and I don't.  You can read it if you've never read Murakami before or if you're desperate for more, but I would never recommend it over, say, _Colorless Tsukuru_.","id":"recVzFFum5nvKXb4E"},{"name":"Caffeine","type":"Book","rating":4,"date":"2020-02-27","author":"Michael Pollon","genre":["Nonfiction","Audiobook"],"dates_consumed":["2020-02-27","2020-02-25"],"image":[{"id":"att2DSrZ1eLa7WYfo","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/6912c07c55bb18a20ffeeb8988dc0fd1/9bcdb12c/d2fdfb6b-0181-41dd-84a2-38aca8dbd4d1-Caffeine.jpgwidth650height650fitcropformatpjpgautowebp","filename":"d2fdfb6b-0181-41dd-84a2-38aca8dbd4d1-Caffeine.jpg?width=650\u0026height=650\u0026fit=crop\u0026format=pjpg\u0026auto=webp","size":42541,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7de86316caf8d50756620d0ce89c2b96/1e760973","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5fb550e7fa3a43ca4f86b633d50d4e88/b7af793e","width":512,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/826fb02ab59e898c3c52d633aedee00f/c154ffd8","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book was a fun listen but I don't think any of it stands up to serious thought or scrutiny","id":"recNXVfKBFEaA4OF3"},{"name":"Marriage Story","type":"Movie","rating":9,"date":"2020-02-28","dates_consumed":["2020-02-28"],"image":[{"id":"att2oMb4jIoDLG0Yp","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c24cbbed4d3077c11e2126cd7168982e/f2ad185b/71qT8yLfqAL._AC_SL1481_.jpg","filename":"71qT8yLfqAL._AC_SL1481_.jpg","size":118711,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4b4bdcec51cc8094a40dcfb5278adbdc/583fbf6e","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/78f5339f4ee8a220bb31517f295c1d74/93eeabcf","width":512,"height":758},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d847eef2ada87dc8824a632bf5648ab8/9fb49f94","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Great and honest performances that honor a great and honest script.","id":"rec3Ed98l3LluTFhp"},{"name":"Parasite","type":"Movie","rating":9,"date":"2020-02-28","dates_consumed":["2020-02-28"],"image":[{"id":"attZeNEHkqHsB5r04","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/f273172bbc80bbca84ba360bd59614a3/5ef8de9e/91sustfojBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","filename":"91sustfojBL._AC_SL1500_.jpg","size":386755,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/a4af3b397a7840c99651e6a5dd2e8c70/e9905c89","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f12c1d73d392432366c3f4a1853e3ab7/76f308db","width":512,"height":791},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c472b1a99524e423a9cfbbec14174ad8/48ffcb86","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Worth the hype.","id":"recBg0ELVqbksozmn"},{"name":"The Farewell","type":"Movie","rating":7,"date":"2020-02-28","dates_consumed":["2020-02-28"],"image":[{"id":"attBppHW7mieNtKmz","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/d7f42aa3c67d226fff8fb958d621cd3e/90879ec9/61-YbvBswcL._AC_SL1481_.jpg","filename":"61-YbvBswcL._AC_SL1481_.jpg","size":111670,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/67e1910ef62c704846d4b80f2ee02bd8/67a78b51","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/90fe1ac7865b4aa1a3ce1aed35125d15/f8ec6851","width":512,"height":758},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ffd5809166329355b765e1fc19c70f21/ab779d2f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Lead performance was bad; everything else (in particular the cinematography of a very different side of China) was great.","id":"recC609Lc4Q9tDmZ0"},{"name":"In Praise of Shadows","type":"Book","dates_consumed":["2020-02-28"],"id":"recOE93jMgcTR12ZG","last_consumed":"2020-02-28"},{"name":"Getting Things Done","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-03-02","genre":["Non-Fiction"],"dates_consumed":["2020-03-02","2020-03-01","2020-02-29","2020-02-28","2020-02-19","2020-02-18","2020-02-17","2020-02-16","2020-02-15","2020-02-14","2020-02-12","2020-02-11"],"image":[{"id":"attRHAfflYHPdLuSl","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/0c4d98040242128d33c7dc62f688e9a5/e20a145b/81trXFlSkCL.jpg","filename":"81trXFlSkCL.jpg","size":393573,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2144ac2fdf7058a372530a5d6768de1a/6fdc4dcd","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b00e8630d9165b092ac25cff67e2c06a/d91c9605","width":512,"height":801},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/53849e03a1f30ce35e818b56b3e1c9fe/7736697f","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"GTD, the methodology: love it.

lieu of more to say, I think this is the most well-designed game I've ever played. The size of a given session is perfect for me (45-75 minutes); the difficulty curve is elegant and sloping; variety is strong. I have poured at least a hundred hours into the game and could see myself pouring a hundred more.\n\nIf you're looking to improve dramatically, I recommend watching [jorbs](https://www.youtube.com/user/JoINrbs) who streams on the highest difficulty. His gameplay both radically improved my skill with the game and taught me a lot about how to approach games writ large.\n\n### Health as currency\n\nThe easiest way to improve your character is to fight elites (monsters who are stronger than normal but offer better cards and items as well as more gold); elites are, as one might imagine, much more dangerous.  There’s a balancing act here: when progressing through an act, you might get to choose between one of three paths: one with one elite fight, one with two elite fights, and one with four elite fights. The path with one elite fight gives you a high chance of survival but a relatively small improvement to your character’s power; the path with four elite fights will dramatically improve your character but you risk dying.\n\nOne of the key strategies of the game is essentially a [Umeshism](https://www.gwern.net/Epigrams#umeshisms) — if you’re ending every act with full health or trying to end every turn with complete block, you’re not being aggressive enough. StS is a game where you need to treat your health as a currency that you spend to improve your character. \n\nIn one of many clever touches by the game designers, this is made explicit in the Ironclad’s starting bonus, which allows you to regenerate health after each fight — not a large amount of health, mind you, but enough to incentivize “blocking with your face” and being aggressive rather than turtling your way to victory.","id":"recFRPOhsMvjDhbpJ"},{"name":"Final Fantasy VII Remake","type":"Game","rating":8,"date":"2020-05-13","console":["PlayStation 4"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-04-24","2020-04-22","2020-04-21","2020-04-25","2020-04-26","2020-04-29","2020-05-01","2020-04-20","2020-04-19","2020-04-18","2020-04-17","2020-04-16","2020-04-15","2020-04-14","2020-05-01","2020-05-10","2020-05-11","2020-05-12"],"i_own_this?":true,"group":"Final Fantasy","image":[{"id":"attNy2Sc4Guaxzn8G","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/5870997b22d2b28c181be43ec373116a/34168ac8/screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","filename":"screen-shot-2019-09-26-at-11-29-49-am.png","size":994319,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9da969aab43fe0bea63f8af109f89554/9f652b39","width":64,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/32e36dad86ff90e52c03be1effcd7331/67b9af9d","width":910,"height":512},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c9c58f5358a7511b9d9c2b3e748ac72a/21bf088a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I didn't think you could remake a game with twenty years of nostalgia and weight behind it and have it be as good as this was.","id":"reclhgU9aMqdMHHSt"},{"name":"Against the Grain","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-05-03","author":"James Scott","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["2020-04-24","2020-04-22","2020-04-25","2020-04-26","2020-04-28","2020-04-29","2020-05-01","2020-05-01","2020-05-03"],"i_own_this?":true,"image":[{"id":"attpH5OXVgCIZwO3V","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/19da395676ca620bfe3136b3f4a3920a/e10c2c0b/61xCjasW1pL.jpg","filename":"61xCjasW1pL.jpg","size":73804,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/400a1d5f36887a60a22c8e83c0ef6e71/7bdccf30","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c264de918d0d3474b7c43497fa7e9f15/79cb05ad","width":512,"height":768},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3963dc95d2743d9ce1922a9bf1388c0f/1e7ee75a","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This was a lot of fun, and I think a better and more persuasive book (largely due to its focus) than Seeing Like A State.

I have fond memories of playing through it in 2012 — in Seattle for the first time — and being blown away, though ultimately I drifted away a little and never finished it.  I was blown away by the scale and scope of the game — an MMO, but as a JRPG!\n\nWhen the remaster came out for Switch, I was excited to finish it, and I'm glad I did.  The quality of life improvements are dramatic, and propelled me through the first half of the game handily: \"listen to podcast, grind and handle a bunch of simple quests\" might sound bad, but it's a very nice gaming mode for me to be in, so I loved that.\n\nI really faded in the last third or so, though, even though I thought the aesthetics and environment were at their peak. I'm not a big RPG completionist but I sped through the ending pretty much as quickly as possible, and after some self-examination I think the reason is simple.\n\nThere's no point to doing pretty much anything in the game.  The most important variable in battle is your level: if you want to do better, level up.  This is so drastically less interesting than a game with parallel grinds (crafting! exploration! arts!) etc, and as soon as you shatter the illusion that all these subsystems actually matter you're left sighing, finding the optimal party to one-hit things with combos, and rushing through the cutscenes.","id":"recRMT5UlMPS8lxlH"},{"name":"Borderlands 2","type":"Game","dates_consumed":["2020-05-30","2020-06-04","2020-06-07"],"image":[{"id":"attMJRgR2nZEQNuj3","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3c7de2da174a0eea23cb4b1d0cd90355/89c2696b/b2.jpg","filename":"b2.jpg","size":191390,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/0768f0a3a9a3fff75fc35622fd8687ac/156cc02f","width":22,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4442e390f82778bf3c73cd91c58474d6/f2f523bf","width":512,"height":838},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5815d2dd0d629422e73702c90ea98097/80c56084","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"id":"recNCFrgHhnkYSG9B","last_consumed":"2020-06-07"},{"name":"Minecraft Dungeons","type":"Game","dates_consumed":["2020-05-31","2020-06-02","2020-06-03","2020-06-09"],"image":[{"id":"attd2EZ4Sq0Rp5NZS","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cead6d39a106e030090ef599cc9d8b04/3677541b/z.jpeg","filename":"z.jpeg","size":19087,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7b956a9fbd4c199f326bf80d1330ef99/b89e4610","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5d905416c134c339315d0d2648510e78/d884b772","width":200,"height":300},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/1aa2cd5153cb7c965291f8b77164dd11/77519a2b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"id":"reczLMDGHx9fIkKX6","last_consumed":"2020-06-09"},{"name":"My Neighbor Totoro","type":"Movie","rating":10,"date":"2020-06-01","genre":["Miyazaki"],"year":"1988","dates_consumed":["2020-06-01"],"image":[{"id":"attNql1xwgFJ7X8mb","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cac6eadcdb2d8e8dbd98495c10c4f7a6/4ac4e945/51m-gcrrj1L._AC_.jpg","filename":"51m-gcrrj1L._AC_.jpg","size":33381,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/26db9a8641a30701f423926206422d1e/68995c41","width":27,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/3f5bbe9930aadfea74008d75a731412f/cea75acd","width":375,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/5bfacfc0501a5c57f556d651289e1bb5/4af06570","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"A perfect movie about warmth and innocence and what it means to be childlike (and what it means to be adult).","id":"recuu1t4lvTVvCZdR"},{"name":"Winners Take All","type":"Book","rating":8,"date":"2020-06-09","author":"Anand Giridharadas","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["2020-06-02","2020-06-03","2020-06-05","2020-06-06","2020-06-07","2020-06-08","2020-06-09"],"upcoming_books":["recpkDtrf9nc3gtKf"],"image":[{"id":"att7qSOIemYoHlkLx","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/659ad876df1e635972d90838b0772800/7b4946b0/wta.jpg","filename":"wta.jpg","size":52207,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/20b30f82c153d07569816ac28d4bd445/298daf54","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/da00cc651cf308cf8178bfb30c77ee95/66a5f019","width":500,"height":752},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/28a179c93f534eb63b5e1eb76baeb7d5/4c5b2785","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"The book is not groundbreaking, and it owes a lot (in terms of \"MarketWorld\" and \"protocols\") to James Scott, but I liked it more than I thought it would.

It is an interesting story about a sad family; it is an interesting self-diagnosis and meditation on what we look for in our family; it is a poem about addiction and loss.  (It only drags in one portion, towards the end, as many memoirs tend to do, which is when the tense turns from past to present: Molly walks us through her retracing of her father's steps as she is writing the book, which as often does has the effect of intimating a personal revelation that cannot turn universal.)\n \nBut the thing overshadowing the rest of the narrative, to me, is knowledge of how Molly's life ends the way it does, with suicide. It is hard not to think about her death when she discusses her mother's suicide attempts, or her grappling with disassociation and trauma.\n\nI sat for a while after finishing this book, in the morning, with my partner asleep on my chest, feeling a little lost.  I searched for more about Molly — her cooking blog, her teaching blog.

Judt makes it clear in his introduction that rather than try and propose a grand theory or specific thesis with which to plumb the six decades following World War II, he wrote the book in an exercise of gestalt:\n\n\u003e I have no big theory of contemporary European history to propose in these pages; no one overarching theme to expound; no single, all-embracing story to tell. It does not follow from this, however, that I think the post-World War Two history of Europe has\nno thematic shape. On the contrary: it has more than one. Fox-like, Europe knows many things.\n\nAs such, this book is a _tome_. You will — I did — learn a lot about the world, especially coming from a meager historical background.  There were lots of revealing areas, and I am forgetting most of them:\n\n- The general richness and inner life of Eastern Europe, which I had largely marginalized and treated as same-y in the Postwar scene\n- The continued vilification of Jews and minorities in the immediate Postwar scene, with the plight of the Holocaust not being magically ended with the conquering of Berlin\n- The role and cleverness of West Germany in maintaining their frame on the world stage, first through ostpolitik and later through diplomacy in the EU\n- The detente and casual comfort with which most of Western Europe treated the USSR (as contrasted with the open conflict that the US felt)\n- The cylicality of eras of social boom and disruption and change\n\nI have no reservations recommending someone read this book: few histories have taught me more. And yet, it fails in many ways as a book: by optimizing for breadth, Judt has deliberately written a transcription rather than a narrative. I listened to this thing for 44 hours: I spent two of those hours on Lithuanian politics that my brain is not yet seasoned enough to place into the rich context it deserves, and the sheer density of events and figures makes it difficult to grasp the enormity of some of the submovements he espouses.\n\nI will probably reread (or relisten) to this again in ten years, and I'll be happy to do so. It can be a slog, but it is rewarding.","notebook":["recYfVN9rcm5gA9jz","recRP5dV50yomKU74","recmrqPqv7TztINbe","recKr8dJ40wVQXj1D","recbWyfQC2xsuFvrE","rec9t6PXwRnS2xW3M","reccJkPIcYFkBPXAg","rectKeQVkqKrLe700"],"source":"Byrne Hobart","isbn":"9781441778208","dictionary":["recuVV49Cb3v7Jlvx","recOKLvDouHcBDTo2","recc2F0rjCTRUnKIu"],"id":"recn1HpznDbe5fXeX"},{"name":"Shape Up","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-07-07","author":"Ryan Singer","genre":["Non-Fiction"],"year":"2018","dates_consumed":["2020-07-07"],"image":[{"id":"attayNL3Sy2BMgr20","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/7240d82b9a05093ef0534b2bd0c33958/defda03b/shapeup.png","filename":"shapeup.png","size":4252,"type":"image/png","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/50e1b28e44012fcddbf257e0cacee822/098ab917","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c80df7fc47f786c87f296a5362247eec/da3e054a","width":181,"height":278},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c831bffecae13f424774fd03fc6b6667/7922fcf2","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This sounds like a damning with faint praise but my favorite part of this book is how short it was!

Some of the fantasy in this book is so exciting and vivid that I spent large swaths of it imagining as a graphic novel, which I think is a testament to the sheer comic-books-excitement of the setting: watching these characters run through a betendriled New York would be delightful.\n\nSo what didn’t work? I think two things: \n\n- The plot (and the characters) were utterly predictable. The two little twists (the villain’s ultimate identity and the last-minute inclusion of Jersey City) were both fun but pretty highly telegraphed, and as soon as the general rules of the world were laid down the plot itself was sort of paint by numbers.\n- The predictability of the plot was exacerbated by how...rote the second act was?

Gone is the rich, beautiful, and terrifying depictions of Naples; gone is the sense of time and evolution that a reader witnesses. What's left is almost a Murakami-esque procession of plot points and themes — sure, Ferrante talks about the difference between order and justice, sure, Ferrante talks about the blinding madness of love, sure, Ferrante talks about the pain of beauty and the pain of gender — but you have heard these things before, and you do not mind hearing them again but you are not blown away by them.","notebook":["recefNtdglzVU43zN"],"dictionary":["recShNEgkYKbQzPw6"],"id":"recwQCkOE2wdVVbMG"},{"name":"The Awful Truth","type":"Movie","rating":7,"date":"2020-09-20","year":"1937","dates_consumed":["2020-09-20"],"image":[{"id":"attwlBhcCzHAABSIy","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/cfa6adccda5f0ddf653425142b4b6bec/322f1d77/awful.jpg","filename":"awful.jpg","size":43427,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/20cea49c16c2d540886e8ad6b62dc550/886ac7c2","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e6fef356ba385b69a6472dfccbf36a05/43dcfdde","width":220,"height":334},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4262b9ef170e5235c16b2069ecc172a4/93798369","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"Just a really, really solid slapstick.

It’s a legitimate contender for GOTY, and deservedly so. The game is interesting, fun, and succeeds at everything that it sets out to do. If I were to try and sum up its victories in a few points, here’s what I’d start with:\n\n- Weapon and build variation mean that characters feel much different within minutes of each run.\n- The core gameplay loop sits at around thirty minutes, which is perfect.\n- Story progression (which fits perfectly within the framing device of the game) is tied to death, so you look forward to losses as opposed to the common roguelike feeling of “well, jeez, that was a waste.”\n- Metaprogression (both in terms of your character getting stronger between runs and the difficulty scaling up in the postgame) is incredibly smooth and elegant.\n\nThe plot, setting, voicing, and art direction are all just really good and, again, tie in extremely well with the story. I’m at a loss to say what can be improved about it: the runs started feeling a little repetitive towards the end, and some of the currency/story unlocking is stingy, but it’s just an incredibly good game and one that I look forward to playing more of down the line.\n\n...So why isn't it a 10? Because it didn't consume my life, I guess. The two most recent 10/10 games I played were CrossCode and Slay The Spire, both of which I daydreamed about and spent shower time thinking about and never wanted to end.

Some scattered thoughts:\n\n- It is slightly disappointing how vacuous the reporting on Early Instagram is, compared to the post-Facebook acquisition. Three hours in and the company’s been bought; the majority of the section didn’t even talk about scaling the company but about Systrom getting various backers and celebrities!\n- It is entertaining though how wholesome the rise to power is compared to Bad Blood or Super Pumped. The thesis of this book is clearly about Systrom being a pretty good guy who tried to protect his work from Facebook.\n- A very interesting aside during the antitrust drama: Facebook’s entire case for it not being a monopolistic move is that they could point to Facebook Camera being a much weaker and less popular app than Instagram, and thus they were doing something rationally competitive (rather than framing it against Facebook’s app itself.) This is ingenious and evil and makes me wonder if all of Facebook’s shovelware apps have the same purpose: to make M\u0026A (and various competitive analyses) more palatable.\n- One useful point this book is emphasizing is just how feature-poor Instagram was for so long. Editing captions; DMs; video posts; none of these things existed pre-acquisition, which is somehow hilarious and trenchant.\n- More Twitter than Instagram, but I was surprised to learn that the Ellen selfie was completely staged. I think a useful point this book makes is that for all the engineering focus I give to social media companies, the partnerships \u0026 celebrity recruiting teams spend so much time and energy manufacturing every possible angle.","notebook":["recTTTNZwSUtqry9a"],"id":"recl4aKKo22YooLeP"},{"name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","type":"Movie","rating":4,"date":"2020-10-03","year":"2007","dates_consumed":["2020-10-03"],"image":[{"id":"att8NbSv1KXYvDX1T","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/3a7e2afeba250fb673fab453c7a78781/a8f341c5/hp5.jpg","filename":"hp5.jpg","size":47156,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/87fba971e20b040e45fa1b8affc895fc/561f64a5","width":26,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/c93f30f4793046720b4f16bd9dcd2e8e/afffec41","width":358,"height":500},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/af269c6f6a092cd980d168b5a7a8d038/ec81876d","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"What a joyless two hours.

The core conceit — a human bank robber — is pleasant and feels ripped from _Bandit_; the characters slowly grow from outright caricatures to _sweet_ outright caricatures (who feel like they'd belong in a Wes Anderson joint, but like, one of the less-regarded ones).\n\nThe writing has some nice moments but is comically saccharine. The author's voice considers themselves authoritatively clever while not actually saying anything particularly clever (an affliction I myself am well-familiar with, from personal experience).

I have some scattered thoughts:\n\n- The writing is gleefully, uh, cheesy. I mean that in an earnest way: it is written pretentiously, it is littered with awful puns, it is delightfully entertaining, it is punchable.\n- I am more interested (and knowledgable) about cheese than when I started the book, which is perhaps the only endorsement this book needs.\n- Around forty percent of this book involves the author palling around at various cheese conferences. This portion should have been wholly excised and the book would have been much stronger for it.\n\nThe most interesting parts of the book come when the author has sudden and fleeting moments of clarity (\"am I an absolute hypocrite for indulging in this culture despite being a vegetarian, given that the dairy industry exploits animals?\" and \"faced with objective proof that my palate is underdeveloped, have I not actually learned anything at all about cheese besides proper nouns?\"). The truth is that I liked this book because it was a microcosm of all consumerist movements. You could replace the references to cheese with craft beer or sourdough or cocktails and I'm sure there are identical books for all three; this is a book about how fun it is to dive into a weird subculture for a little, even as it passes you by.

The translator’s preamble, which both accurately called me out as a “person whose only experience with Beowulf was a stilted translation delivered in a high-school English class” (I’m paraphrasing, but the spirit is there) and delivered in wonderful prose a rallying cry for why Beowulf, and epics in general, are worth reading.\n2. The prose itself! It is delightful to listen to. I think there was a bit of concern that the translation — featuring “bro”, “swole”, “fucked up”, and more neologisms — was going to be a bit dated-by-design, but it was wonderful, rhythmic and modern and mellifluous.\n3. The substance of the book itself (of course buoyed by the first two points):\n    1. One thing similar to the Greek epics: the emphasis on storytelling (which, duh, epic poem, oral tradition, yadda yadda yadda). There’s more discussion about having fought things than actual fighting; there’s more boasting than proving of boasts; there’s more memory of good kings than actions of good kings.\n    2. One thing different (and, in retrospect, very similar to the Poem of the Cid which I did not exactly love) — the emphasis on fealty to king and kingdom. You don’t really notice it as much — except maybe in the Iliad, but that’s different — but the only fealty in the Greek epics are to gods, and yet in Beowulf (and, again, The Cid) there’s this strange power dynamic of the glorious warrior’s subservience to their majesty.\n\nAnyway, this book was fun. I think As An Epic it still pales in comparison to the Iliad or the Odyssey, but the translation is delightful and it gave me much to think about.\n","notebook":["rec4uD2zUZRgyxrhF","rec7uc7HgZ9duOG4f","recSrDnvFOgjVUXS7","recuz8r17KeEbJZ1K"],"id":"recKwmrPKyLUZIGAx"},{"name":"The Searcher","type":"Book","rating":6,"date":"2020-12-02","author":"Tara French","genre":["Audiobook","Fiction"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-11-18","2020-11-22","2020-11-23","2020-11-25","2020-11-24","2020-11-28","2020-11-29","2020-11-30","2020-12-02"],"image":[{"id":"atteNzzfAPwqYmr31","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/e335cfdd10903e8bfe346b53428ff726/2633237f/searcher.jpg","filename":"searcher.jpg","size":139143,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4620d9e19bb545ee968a180b99bd9a1a/ed3ecb27","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b78cbdcf006b4ed921f1137edf6efaa7/cd617137","width":265,"height":400},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/110706cd54273633cb20b8dc3b9907b0/4dd39cf5","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I don't really feel like I have a grasp on this book.

There are, I guess, suggestions of conflict and stakes — will Cameron Diaz’s character stay in England? will Kate Winslet break free of her manipulative boss? — but you know exactly how every plot line will unfold and resolve within the first ten minutes of the film. The moments of genuine surprise — Jude Law’s character having two children, Dustin Hoffman randomly being in a Blockbuster — are joyous.  All this movie is is a vehicle to let some charming people bounce around each other’s orbit and to make you feel slightly warmer, and it does that very well. \n\nI think the two quibbles I have are:\n\n1. It is one hundred and forty minutes! That is too long for an airy romantic comedy. Cut out thirty minutes of the fluff (though I suppose one would argue that it’s _all_ fluff) and it’s a much leaner enterprise.\n2. The movie suggests at some clever meta-commentary on romantic comedies, between the WGA playing a role and the (fairly well-done!) non-diegetic movie trailer shenanigans. It could have leaned into this like three degrees more and still gotten some mileage, I think.","id":"rec5k16VCcQJZPJCb"},{"name":"You Never Forget Your First","dates_consumed":["2020-12-02","2020-12-03","2020-12-05","2020-12-08","2020-12-09","2020-12-10","2020-12-11","2020-12-12"],"image":[{"id":"att6Jpn3UPiiQDEsv","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/446342946e442a3586a0fb5645021dc3/030bb431/first.jpg","filename":"first.jpg","size":350587,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e765f2dd2275d19ccd1574b1dc105846/c864f1d1","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/9676fac5a7fb12c9833f826bab381b0f/b45706fd","width":512,"height":773},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/bb8e85529c38aee1e3b35213ab350cdd/e24b4a41","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"dictionary":["recH38rTd7c6iC3T7","recsxgq4lPwwkLSzU"],"id":"recuzhIHKPP42jiSD","last_consumed":"2020-12-12"},{"name":"Digital Minimalism","type":"Book","rating":4,"date":"2020-12-07","author":"Cal Newport","genre":["Audiobook","Non-Fiction"],"year":"2019","dates_consumed":["2020-12-05","2020-12-06","2020-12-07"],"image":[{"id":"attAi9pImbbrKaZMB","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/c8faa6dc1c293c2ed4bf3026896c8ba2/ca95817a/dm.jpg","filename":"dm.jpg","size":38160,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/e939628fec593fecabac5dfae5aed8c7/a571f551","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7ed14a8403710812fb727e51aa84316a/1e4e3d3d","width":331,"height":499},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/b00baeb76d8d36ccb7732646e7ef9c49/117cd507","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"I find myself weirdly torn on this book.\n\nIt's a thesis that I strongly espouse and agree with (we should use our phones less, we should disengage from social media) and imparted at least one concept that I plan to fold into my daily practice (holding \"personal office hours\" to make constant availability a thing around which I and others can plan).\n\nIt's also just _so_ shittily researched. Within the first thirty pages Newport namechecks Tristan Harris, Bill Maher, and Anderson Cooper. In the next sixty he deputizes Abraham Lincoln, Thoreau (Walden is mentioned, of course), and Martin Luther King into his argument. He expands on the \"nature of craft\" by talking about a dude from Portland who wrote a book about craft and Mr. Money Moustache. All of these anecdotes are delivered with the prose and stature of an overlong Medium post.\n\nOkay, maybe I'm not actually that torn after all. \"Overlong Medium post\" neatly sums it up; this is a book that has reasonable arguments surrounded by terrible writing. It might successfully persuade you of something, but it will not teach you anything.","id":"recVeNuPUYvzWILEQ"},{"name":"Little Eyes","dates_consumed":["2020-12-07","2020-12-09","2020-12-10","2020-12-11","2020-12-12","2020-12-13"],"image":[{"id":"attoxkmk4UZldT8xU","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/24defa60d4fb143dd7a512972c6bc625/058af073/le.jpg","filename":"le.jpg","size":50090,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/61caff280ceb7aeac214d5408bc224de/88c914ec","width":23,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/00aba6957d595c8112cc0d4aea0343cc/3807eebc","width":300,"height":471},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/cb3259453d35f1c9fd5035ca4751b0c3/fda6b9e3","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"id":"recJN6Rhinz35P4uc","last_consumed":"2020-12-13"},{"name":"Paul Rand: Conversations with Students","type":"Book","rating":7,"date":"2020-12-11","author":"Michael Kroeger","year":"2008","dates_consumed":["2020-12-11"],"image":[{"id":"attlJU8oHpYIXIi23","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/226eb2cf0f952ec07cf5dfc10890209f/2863fdc6/pr.jpg","filename":"pr.jpg","size":18555,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/2d9d8d92fa4705e5e9b2aa1334b23bbf/9e14f2cc","width":24,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/f7603c9efd923377d15c56cfecf786e6/e1495519","width":332,"height":499},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/fa6b814c8f5bde3999472166ee0666c3/977e1c0b","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This is a small and quiet pearl of a book: a handful of discourses driven by Rand interspersed with a number of microbiographies of how various students and professionals met and worked with him. A disparaging review on Amazon called it \"the equivalent of a collection of out takes, the stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor, which gets added onto DVD's as a an extra feature\" and I think that is fair! But also the outtakes are fun and interesting and gave me more things to think about and books into which to research than most other books of its size: which, to be clear, is extremely small. This is a book that will take you forty minutes to read and another forty minutes to ponder and is worth the price of admission, but it is not a treatise or a thesis. It is snippets of interesting and thought-provoking conversations, and that's valuable in of itself.","source":"Kathy Sun","id":"reckTLCDzHadlPz9H"},{"name":"We Will Always Love You","type":"Album","rating":10,"date":"2020-12-12","author":"The Avalanches","genre":["Electronic"],"year":"2020","dates_consumed":["2020-12-12"],"image":[{"id":"attcfbvaFGwYxns12","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/fb3bb5c4641bff3fe8e3e81ee6048786/035acac0/av.jpg","filename":"av.jpg","size":26673,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/4957ddf70d66ea40df15c031a43885eb/cb5792ce","width":36,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/d9505e4976613cc2a4d9aa1f5541844a/f423fd60","width":310,"height":310},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/60b11ad4e437269aa07bf3d5ff151b84/584e87c6","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"The Jamie XX feature and Leon Bridges _alone_ make this a classic but wow the entire thing is just beautiful from start to finish.","id":"recDIpwnWCbNTdLsc"},{"name":"Thoughts on Design","type":"Book","rating":5,"date":"2020-12-12","author":"Paul Rand","genre":["Design"],"year":"1947","dates_consumed":["2020-12-12"],"image":[{"id":"att1WkdCOwc0Vre2Y","url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachments/efc2e0a49a8db25489a3e74651ef36fe/fcd5b864/2020-12-1314.51.56.jpg","filename":"2020-12-13 14.51.56.jpg","size":58079,"type":"image/jpeg","thumbnails":{"small":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/ca0619faa8a7b2aadf087884b472e6b1/4f08cd6f","width":30,"height":36},"large":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/feae4e0ccd4d2e4d027f1dd9b9f56c9e/ece745e8","width":318,"height":380},"full":{"url":"https://dl.airtable.com/.attachmentThumbnails/7241371ae29c7f748e180f7360e46cfb/dcd48429","width":3000,"height":3000}}}],"summary":"This book was a disappointment.
