I like to play video games! (I'm currently playing <strong>{{ site.data.currently[1]['name_(from_content)'] }}</strong>.)

As you'll probably realize quickly, I'm a sucker for JRPGs and the RPG genre in general,
but even within those confines I'm fairly normcore (lots of Final Fantasy, Fire Emblem, 
and Pokemon â€” though maybe describing my RPG tastes as normcore is showing that I care
too much about the niche.)

(Also, be warned: **my writeups will probably contain spoilers.**)
