I am not a movie buff, but, uh, here you go. I think I _want_ to be a film person more than I currently am; I certainly
have outgrown my television phase [^1] but I don't make a particularly strong habit of watching movies.

There is one exception to this, which is that almost every Sunday night for the past year my partner and I have watched a movie together. These come in phases — we had our Miyazaki phase, our pre-code screwball phase, and our Harry Potter phase — but it's been a really nice tradition.

(Also, be warned: **my writeups will probably contain spoilers.**)
