When I was in high school and even more insufferable than I am now, a friend and I started a tumblr called "sun words".  The concept of this was to collect words that we discovered that were particularly succulent or mellifluous. [^1]

I have found myself learning more and more words recently.  This is fun and good: I was worried for a while that my days of adapting and playing with the English language were largely behind me.  I thought it would be interesting and illustrative to collect a list of the words I've learned recently alongside the sources from which I've gleaned them. (I expect the majority to be from the NYT crossword, which I recommend you start doing.)

[^1]: Why "sun words"? Because we were high schoolers, and because we learned of the concept of "SAT words" — words that made Flesch-Kincaid salivate — and because _Sun_day comes after _Sat_urday.  (I told you — insufferable.)
