# Notes on newsletters

## Advice 

### Robin Sloan on dividing your newsletter into seasons

> A personal email newsletter ought to be divided into seasons, just like a TV show.
>
> By “personal” I don’t mean “diaristic” but rather “produced almost entirely by one writer, in order to pursue some interest and/or establish a small business.”
>
> Here’s what you get from the nomenclature, the metaphor, of the “season”:
>
> - a sense of progress: of going and getting somewhere.
> - an opportunity for breaks: to pause and reflect, reconfigure.
> - an opportunity, furthermore, to make big changes: in terms of subject, structure, style.
> 
> When do you break between seasons? Anytime! When life gets weird. When you’re feeling burnt out. When you sense a new obsession taking shape. When you want to bring in a guest writer. When it’s raining outside. Really: anytime.

### Craig Mod on voice

> Have killer voice. How do you develop killer voice? Be confident. How do you develop confidence? Read oodles and write oodles more. If you’re sending a “list newsletter” you better have one hell of a point of view because, well, there are oodles-upon-oodles of list newsletters out there. Generally, like with much good writing, the magic for readers is in feeling like they’re traveling along with someone who truly cares and is exceedingly curious about their chosen topic. Be that person / guide / spirit animal! [Craig Mod](https://craigmod.com/essays/on_writing_good_newsletters/)
