# Choosing a project

My thesis is simple: if you want to create a profitable side project, you want to identify an opportunity that meets four criteria:

1. The project is niche and/or boring.
2. The project can exist without much day-to-day maintenance or ongoing investment.
3. The project is in a space with obvious competitors against which you can position yourself.
4. The project is obviously monetizable, and the value you offer grows over time.

## Choose a boring niche

> The Internet is vast, and this tends to create everybody-wins. There is a virtually inexhaustible range of niches out there. Seriously -- one giant, flowing river of value creating. You are able to dip a bucket into it. You may not end up with your own private ocean (hello, Google) but you will also probably not die of thirst.

I was skeptical of this thesis for a long time. 

Largely, my skepticism came from the fact that the people espousing this thesis were asking me to pay them money in order to learn more. [^1] It sounds like a pleasant too-good-to-be-truism, this idea that there are all of these incredible opportunities to hit five digits’ worth of monthly recurring revenue right below your nose.

And sometimes it _is_ too good to be true. The median idea you come up with will probably not hit $5K MRR, especially if you (like me) are a developer at heart. ”Build something people want” and ”Build something you’d use” are both good pieces of advice, but if you’re a software developer who spends time in the tech industry both of those axioms will result in folks building developer tools and other items that already have a very saturated target market.

Nick Disabato, in a podcast episode or essay I can’t for the life of me find, mentioned that the best software business he encountered was for kitchen countertop fabricators. [^2] This has always been my Platonic ideal: a quiet, uninteresting industry that could benefit from some CRUD apps with a bit of domain expertise. Here are some successful businesses in that vein:

- [Kudoboard](http://kudoboard.com/), a CRUD wrapper around Giphy and Printful and sells in the $X,000 range to any non-tech-friendly organization that has hundreds or more of employees (think NGOs, hospitals, and the like.)

## Choose a project with near-infinite runway
